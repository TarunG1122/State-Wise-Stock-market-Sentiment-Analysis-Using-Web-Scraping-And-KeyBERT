"My best memory will be scoring my first brace for Karnataka during the 2015 Senior Nationals - Trichy" Shares a Football enthusiast Lilly Mary Thomas
It was my first time playing for the state and I was suffering from a hamstring pull on my right leg which hampered my performance gravely. Though injured I played with grit and scored two goals. When I scored my first goal I was so overwhelmed, I nearly took off my jersey. We won against Andhra Pradesh 3-0 and I was featured in the local newspaper.
On 26th June 2017, I got the opportunity to play with Sunil Chettri and ex BFC players. I love to embarrass the guys and unfortunately Shankar Sampingiraj bore the brunt of it, he got nutmegged !! Chettri passed comments like ‚ÄúGood shots‚Äù, ‚Äúsmart girl‚Äù and ‚Äúthank you for giving us something to make fun of Shankar‚Äù. That day made me feel content.
Back in school, Football was the only sport I hadn‚Äôt tried because it was only for boys and they said it‚Äôs a dangerous game for the girls. But I was drawn to the game like a moth is drawn toward a flame. I literally begged the boys to join me in, but they wouldn‚Äôt let me play. As no one wanted to be a goalkeeper, I asked if I could goal keep. So, I picked up the game from there and played all the positions. Being self-taught and long hours of training churned me into a grit player and I got chosen to be a part of the school team.
My best childhood memory is playing football in the rain. It would be pouring cats and dogs, the mud ground we played on would get slippery so we would play barefoot. At the end of the game, we‚Äôd chase each other and throw mud around. We‚Äôd be covered in mud from head to toe and it made it difficult to get recognized. Those are the days I crave endlessly.
I attain freedom every time I play this beautiful game. There is no room for judgment, it‚Äôs a medium through which I can get out my emotions. This sport churned me into a sturdy individual who is fearless to face incalculable challenges that life beholds.
Football molded me into this dynamic individual I am today. I want every child to know that despite your background, creed, gender, caste we all are one and nothing should hamper your success. Take risks it will show you your self and don‚Äôt fret about the past because the future will define you.
Football is not merely a sport, it‚Äôs a teacher or guide in disguise. Playing this sport reveals to you the essence of living life with intention and sacrifice. It pushes us beyond boundaries to take risks and fight for what we believe in.
I would love to play until my last walking day. I‚Äôll probably miss the whole team vibe and spirit the most since there is no game without a team.
Thank you for sharing your story with us and we wish you good luck with your future endeavors.

unlike traditional companies, the basic structure of DAO is not based on any form of hierarchical management.A DAO has no centralised ruling power.
So why are they the future? well unlike traditional companies, ownership is permissionless and the information you see is completely public and not private.

What a lack of ideology can do to you. Can easily be a traitor to what you stood for, in the matter of a week. Now, we will soon see him spreading the same politics of hate against which he used to speak.
Well, sanghism runs in the scindia family.

Supreme Court upholds validity of PMLA; passage of amendments as money bill to be decided by larger bench.

*Gist of SC Judgment*
1) SC upheld ED powers of inquiry, arrest, and attachment of property. The bench upholds the validity of various provisions of the PMLA and says that stringent conditions for bail under the Act are legal and not arbitrary.
2) ED, SFIO, DRI officials not "police" -- statements recorded during the inquiry are valid evidence, the bench says.
3) However, the apex court held that the question of enactment of amendments in 2019 to the PMLA Act as money bill has to be decided by a larger bench of seven judges before whom the same question is already pending.
4) SC also says that it is not mandatory for ED officers to disclose the ground of arrest at the time of detaining an accused in a money laundering case.
5)The top court upholds strict bail provisions under the PMLA.
6) The bench says it is not necessary to give an ECIR copy to the accused

Corporate lessons from political happenings in Maharashtra

1. Top Boss must be accessible to ALL: MLAs rebelled due to inaccessible CM. 

2. Wrong business Alliances can break your company: SS entered into an alliance which was against the political ideology. Cultural integration became an issue, ultimately failed. 

3. If unemployed, be ready to accept one level down position: Devendra Fadanvis assumed the post of Deputy CM after serving as the CM in his last stint. 

4. Experience is superior to the inheritance: 2/3 of the MLAs supported Mr. Shinde who is a home grown talent of the party over the political heirs of Late Shri Balasaheb Thackeray. 

5. Do not neglect your middle management: a neglected middle manager can be the future CEO of another company..

6. When the other party needs an alliance: negotiate hard- NCP and INC grabbed meaty portfolios in previous govt. They were aware about the shorter life span of the alliance. 

And the last one: CEO can't be on WFH

BEAUTIFUL STORY ü•∞‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

My wife was sleeping next to me... and all of a sudden I got a Facebook notification, a woman asked me to add her. So I added her. I accepted the friend request and sent a message asking, "Do we know each other?"
She replied: "I heard you got married but I still love you."

She was a friend from the past. She looked very beautiful in the picture. I closed the chat and looked at my wife, she was sleeping soundly after her exhausting day of work. 
Looking at her, I was thinking about how she feels so safe that she can sleep so comfortably in a completely new home with me.

She is far from her parents' house, where she spent 24 hours surrounded by her family. When she was upset or sad, her mother was there so she could cry in her lap. Her sister or brother would tell jokes and make her laugh. Her father would come home and bring her everything she liked and still, she placeed so much trust in me.
All these thoughts came to mind, so I picked up the phone and pressed "BLOCK".
I turned to her and slept next to her. 

I am a man, not a child. I have sworn to be faithful to her and so it will be. I will fight forever to be a man who doesn't cheat on his wife and tear a family apart....

Till very recently, Yes Bank was the darling of Indian stock markets. At its peak in 2017 it was valued at $13.4bn, making its co-founder and CEO, Rana Kapoor, a billionaire. Even then there were signs that all was not well. As far back as 2013 concerns were raised by a small group of skeptics at the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) that Yes Bank had grown at an extraordinary pace and had reported a very small number of bad loans, even though it lent to some of India‚Äôs most distressed companies. Then in 2015, the first doubts began to be aired publicly about Yes Bank‚Äôs loan portfolio. UBS published a report suggesting that Mr. Kapoor‚Äôs bets were not always working out. Alarmingly, the report said Yes Bank had lent around 125 per cent of its net worth to stressed companies.

Soon after the UBS report, the RBI opened what‚Äôs called an Asset Quality Review (AQR) which, as the name suggests, looks at the loans on a bank‚Äôs books. Before the AQR in 2015, bankers avoided recognizing bad loans on their books. They did this by restructuring the loans susceptible to defaults or by extending new loans, called ever-greening, to keep the stressed borrowers afloat. Thus, while the borrowers were able to avoid defaults on repayments, the lenders managed to show low non-performing assets (NPAs).

What came out of Yes Bank's AQR was nothing short of staggering. The RBI found that for the year ended March 2016, Yes Bank had understated gross NPAs by a whopping ‚Çπ4,176.70 crore. For the year ended March 2017, the under reporting was to the tune of ‚Çπ6,355 crore!! This eventually led to RBI forcing Rana Kapoor out of Yes Bank and bringing in a new management team. Not much changed however. For the year ended March 2019, the RBI discovered under-reported NPAs worth ‚Çπ2,299 crore. Finally in early March 2020, RBI decided enough was enough and took control of the company and its Board.

"The Lender of Last Resort"

So how did things come to such a pass? Rana Kapoor had always been a banking industry superstar. He spent 16 years at Bank of America and then moved to ANZ Grindlays as India country head. But he entertained greater ambitions and envisaged creating his own organisation in an era when few executives harbored such dreams. In 2004, he set up Yes Bank along with his brother-in-law Ashok Kapur.

For years, it seemed Yes Bank could do no wrong. It was seen as a welcome modernizer, a breath of fresh air in India‚Äôs banking sector, ushering in new technologies and a fresh customer-focused approach to banking. And Kapoor relished risk, aggressively lending money in a conservative banking landscape. While private sector rival HDFC Bank focused on the traditional retail sector, Yes Bank had no hesitation about loaning to the business sector. In India‚Äôs corporate sector, there were many who called Kapoor "the lender of last resort" who would lend even to financially strapped corporations but would ensure that Yes Bank always made its money. Mr. Kapoor recovered money from groups like Deccan Chronicle and Vijay Mallya‚Äôs United Breweries, which have had huge financial troubles over the years. 

Inevitably, with such high risk strategies, Yes Bank's luck eventually ran out. It ended up lending funds to companies such as Anil Ambani‚Äôs Reliance, the Essel Group (Zee), IL&FS, Jet Airways, Cox & Kings and Vodafone, all of which ran into deep financial trouble. 

The troubles that Yes Bank was running into was in plain sight. Yet RBI and the stock market analysts chose to look the other way. Just one simple question everyone should have asked but few did : how did the bank grow its loan book by 80% between March 31, 2017, and March 31, 2019, when the economy was down and credit demand unusually low? Yes Bank‚Äôs loan book grew from Rs 1,32,000 crore in FY 2017 to Rs 2,41,000 crore in FY 2019. That is an increase of Rs 1,09,000 crore or 80% in just two years, when most banks were finding it difficult to lend.

In hindsight, Mr Kapoor and YES Bank may have been given too long a rope.

What can we learn from the crisis?

What next?

The largest bank in the country, State Bank of India, has been parachuted in by RBI to save Yes Bank. SBI will hold up to 49% stake in the bank, with an assurance it will not go below 26% for three years. For all practical purposes, it is an indirect use of public resources to bail out a failed private bank. It was however unavoidable; the only way to preserve the integrity of the financial system and insulate a fragile economy from more damage. All central banks have learnt a lesson post the Lehman crisis of 2008. Letting a bank fail is no longer a viable option.

The Yes Bank episode drives home the point that India‚Äôs financial sector is fragile. A part of the problem has been poor supervisory performance of RBI. The outcome is that the taxpayer has been repeatedly burdened by bailouts; the Punjab National Bank (PNB) bailout of 2018 is still fresh in everyone's mind. There is scant evidence that these bailouts are accompanied by governance reforms or an improvement in RBI‚Äôs regulatory and supervisory skills.

India's banking industry is at a critical juncture. Banks including South Indian Bank Ltd. and Karnataka Bank Ltd. are among lenders that are at high risk for reasons including their weaker capital buffers and lower provisions for loans. Meanwhile, Federal Bank Ltd., RBL Bank and IndusInd Bank have had to issue statements to refute speculation about weaknesses in their balance sheets. Unless we learn from the Yes Bank fiasco, other bank failures cannot be ruled out.

As Winston Churchill once famously said....."Those who fail to learn from history are condemned to repeat it". Given the current stressed economic environment, we can ill afford a banking crisis in India.

The Uttar Pradesh State government promulgated the Prohibition of Unlawful Religious Conversion Ordinance, 2020 which is also popularly labeled as ‚ÄúLove Jihad Law‚Äù by many people. The said law was enacted on 24 th November 2020 by the state governor Anandiben Patil. The legislation deals with the regulation of religious conversions and forbids any particular religious conversion by force, coercion, allurement or any other undue influence. The states of Karnataka and Himachal Pradesh are also in line to enact such a law which prohibits inter-faith marriages with the sole or primary objective of religious conversion.

The Ordinance explains conversion as renouncing one‚Äôs current faith and adopting another of the same. The law contains a particular procedure for any person looking to convert his/her religion and only if through the prescribed procedure the conversion has done, it will be considered valid and otherwise it shall be subject to criminal penalty.

The law is in heavy criticism due to its severe penalties and a complex procedure. The Allahabad High Court also while quashing a FIR stated that ‚ÄúRight to choose a partner, irrespective of religion, is intrinsic to right to life and personal liberty‚Äù.

The Kerala Police (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020 was enacted on November 20, 2020 by the governor of the state Arif Mohammad Khan. The Ordinance is the amendment to the Kerala Police Act, 2011. The 2020 ordinance administers the powers and duties of the law enforcement agency in the state of Kerala. The amendment in section 118(a) confers to enforce punishment for offences related to threat, humiliation or defamation.

The Ordinance proposes a criminal liability on any expression, publication or dissemination of threatening, abusive, defamatory or humiliating content made through any mode of communication punishable if the person does it knowing it to be false and damaging to reputation or mind of another person. The ordinance had landed various criticisms throughout the country and in the state of Kerala.

The opposition states this legislation as an attack against the Article 19 of the Constitution of India which ensures Freedom of speech to every individual. The Editors Guild of India had also urged the Chief Minister of Kerala to withdraw such ‚ÄúDisturbing‚Äù legislation which not only suppresses the freedom of press but also provides the police agency with intemperate power to target any person under the cover of this Ordinance.

However the Kerala Government has decided to withdraw this Ordinance to revise its consequences. The Chief Minister of Kerala has stated that the Ordinance was promulgated to curb defamation and the spread of fake news but due to such apprehensions which were raised after the enactment of this Ordinance the matter has been taken to reconsideration.

The Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020 was promulgated on November 4, 2020 by the President of India. The primary objective of the Act is to assure that all the stakeholders get an opportunity to seek for unconditional stay of enforcement of arbitral awards where the underlying arbitration agreement or contract or making of the arbitral award are induced by fraud or corruption.

The Ordinance amends the ‚Äòautomatic stay on awards‚Äô clause of the principal act and the 2015 amendment of the principal act. The ordinance provides that a stay on arbitral can be provided even during the pendency of the setting aside application if the court is satisfied that the concerned arbitral agreement or arbitral award was brought through fraud or corruption. Further, after this amendment the courts will have to be more careful in granting an unconditional stay on enforcement of the arbitral award.

The insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Ordinance 2020 was promulgated by the President of India on 5 June, 2020. The principal Code (IBC 2016) provides a corporate debtor as well as its creditors to constitute corporate insolvency resolution process in case of insolvency.

The 2020 Amendment Ordinance by introducing section 10(a) prorogates any such proceedings for defaults arising during the six months from 25 March 2020 (extendable up-to one year). The government believes that the lockdown initiated due to COVID-19 pandemic has caused disruption to various businesses. This non-functioning of businesses might led them into insolvency and therefore the promulgation of this amendment is necessary.

The proviso after section 10(a) of the Amendment states that no application for corporate insolvency resolution process shall ever be filed against a corporate debtor for any default occurring during the suspension period. This may result in a scenario where creditors are unable to hold the company liable for these defaults even after the company is in the capacity to repay.

The President of India on 22 April, 2020 promulgated the Epidemic Disease (Amendment) Ordinance 2020. The Ordinance amends the Epidemic Disease Act, 1897. The principal Act provides for prevention against the spread of any disease which is dangerous for human life. The Ordinance amends the Act to ensure the protection and safety of healthcare personnel working against prevention from the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Ordinance defines healthcare personnel as any person who is in direct contact with affected patients or at a risk of being impacted by such disease while carrying out his/her responsibilities related to the epidemic.

These healthcare personnel include:

The Ordinance provides for enforcement of criminal liability against any person who initiates any ‚Äòact of violence‚Äô against the healthcare personnel. The criminal liability consists of an imprisonment between three months and five years, and a fine between Rs 50,000/- and 2,00,000/-. The ordinance further provides that the trail against the person guilty of above said offence should be concluded within one year.

The Farmers‚Äô Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance, 2020 was promulgated by the President of India on 5 th June 2020. This Ordinance provides for institution of an ecosystem where the farmers and traders enjoy the freedom of choice relating to sale and purchase of farmer‚Äôs produce which facilitates higher prices for commodities due to competitive alternative trading channels.

The Ordinance‚Äôs primary objective is to increase the availability of buyers for farmers‚Äô product by providing them with the options of intra-state and inter-state trade. These outside premises includes

The Ordinance further permits the electronic trading of scheduled farmers‚Äô produce in the specified trade area. The Ordinance restrains the state government from levying any market fee, cess or levy on farmers, traders, and electronic trading platforms. This ordinance is right now in the question due to the backlash of farmers especially from the state of Punjab and Haryana.

The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Ordinance, 2020 was promulgated by the President of India on 5 th June 2020. This Ordinance aims for a national well-designed structure on farming agreements that protects and empowers farmers to engage with agri-business firms, processors, wholesalers, exporters or large retailers for farms services.

This Ordinance provides for an agreement between farmer and a buyer prior to the production of any crops. The agreement shall be for a minimum time period of one crop season, or one production cycle of livestock. The maximum period of the agreement is five years unless the production cycle is more than five years. The Ordinance also provides for conciliation incase of any dispute between the farmer and the buyer. The farming agreement must provide a conciliation board for dispute resolution. If the dispute remains unresolved by the board, parties may approach the SDM for resolution. The parties may also approach appellate authority in case they are not satisfied with the decision of the magistrate.

The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020 was promulgated by the President of India on 5th June 2020. This Ordinance amends the principal Act (Essential Commodities Act, 1955).

The Ordinance is promulgated for the purpose of increasing the competitiveness in the agriculture sector and enhancing the income of the farmers. The ordinance provides that the government may administer the production, supply, distribution and trade of essential commodities only under extra-ordinary circumstances.

These circumstances consist of (i) war, (ii) famine, (iii) extraordinary price rise and (iv) natural calamity of grave nature.

The Ordinances demands that imposition of any stock limit on agriculture produce must be on the basis of change in prices. The Ordinance may help the farmer by attracting private investment in cold storage, warehouses etc. The ordinance may also bring stability in prices and raise farmer‚Äôs income.
