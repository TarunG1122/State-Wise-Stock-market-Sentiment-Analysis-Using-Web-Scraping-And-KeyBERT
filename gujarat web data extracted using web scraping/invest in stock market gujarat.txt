One of the most powerful concepts in the investing world is Mean Reversion.

Mean Reversion means that any asset volatility taking it sky high will be pulled back towards the long term average level. This is a fundamental truth that does play out without fail. Think of it like the law of averages. In the long term, the pendulum swings back to the mean.

By Mean Reversion, I don’t imply that the price of a stock necessarily reverts back to its mean. It’s the market multiples that I am taking about. A stock price is a function of its earnings and the valuation multiple that investors assign to the earning capacity. This valuation multiple is the moot point of mean reversion. 

It’s pertinent to note that an optically high P/E based on past earnings does not mean that the stock is expensive. The market multiple depends on the future earnings capacity and predictability, not on past profits. Hence, the function of time for the play out of mean reversion may differ from stock to stock; in some cases, it many happen soon, in others, it may take longer.

In every market cycle, we invariably find a mad rush for buying expensive names. Now, we must note that even if Mean Reversion takes a while to play out, the market track record bears testimony to the fact that the shares don’t always create big Alpha vs the Nifty. Therefore, be forewarned before buying anything super expensive, no matter how great the company, and how alluring the value prop!

Ignore Mean Reversion at your own peril.

I see a huge amount of content on LinkedIn that focuses on:

Entrepreneurs
Founders
Business leaders
Tech startups 

While these are important, is it time for us to rebalance the conversation? The vast majority of people work as employees for businesses, which is a brilliant and legitimate course to take. 

Without them, society simply would not function. 

It’s time the online content reflects that.

driven by growth

Seriously thinking about how this could happen.
Germany, the economic super power - the country many have left their home countries for (including my parents) to be part of something big that leads into a better future.

I´ve been in corporate innovation for about 10 years, now working at GlassDollar (making innovation accessible for corporates). And all in all I do see the brave, fast, bold companies that DARE to innovate and stay competitive. 

But what I also see in extensive discussions on conferences or whichever external job related point of exchange:
The innovation game in #Germany is still quite immature, and produces shiny surfaces instead of results (like either cutting costs or generating more/additional revenue).

I am really happy and grateful to be born, raised and educated in #germany and I am aware of my privilege. And I do believe that Germany is and will be amongst the economic global leaders. I do believe that this negative development Janosch Kühn (Sadowski) pointed out in this post can still be a wake-up call and the fuel for a more bold approach to build cutting edge businesses.

I do believe that innovation in times of crisis can and will be the game changer. Thanks for the "food for thought" Janosch!

What do you think is the reason why innovation runs slow in Germany?

🇩🇪 Is Germany losing its edge? 

The war, energy crisis, pandemic, supply chain issues, ...! The list is endless! 

With ongoing crises and problems worldwide, it gets harder for everyone. 

Recent statistics show that companies in Germany, in particular, are struggling with that. The economy can't keep up! 

📈 A few years earlier, German companies dominated the stock exchange. Daimler, BMW & co. - names, known worldwide. 

But today, these companies are being left behind by big empires like Tesla or Apple! 

2007: 7 German companies could make it into the top 100 most valuable companies! 

📉In 2019 it was only Siemens and SAP! 

This year the sad news; no German company made it to the top 100. Not even SAP! 

Seeing this data is shocking, for sure. But it also should push us to keep looking for more companies with great ambitions and a great vision! Companies that could change the world! 

Because I know there are many founders who have brilliant ideas and want to change the world! 

💪 To get German companies back on the list, we have a lot of work to do.  

❓ What do we need to change?

Background

ABC company is a real estate multinational giant looking for investments in the state of Gujarat by the invitation of the Government of Gujarat. The aim of the study is to cluster different cities(districts) on the basis of various parameters to differentiate between the type of investments to be done. The parameters selected for this study are:

Data Requirements

The data needed are:

The data for districts is extracted from the web using web scraping, the location attributes are obtained using the python library Geopy and the venues at each district can be extracted by the use of foursquare API.

Data Cleaning

The unwanted rows and columns are dropped, the location attributes are added and the population growth percentage is calculated to make the final data set required.

The venues are extracted for each district and top ten venues are found out.

Methodology

The clustering is done based on the population growth and the urban development. This is on the assumption that more venues in a city, more developed it is. Now, the clustering is done on these basis:

Results

The results are combined into a matrix with categories as high, medium and low. A further sub clustering was done on the lower cluster of combined population growth and urban development result for further analysis.

Discussion

Limitations

Conclusion

The clusters obtained opens the possibilities of investments in the state of Gujarat. ABC company now has a better view of the state which should be deepened with further analysis. The Cluster A has cities which are fast growing. The competition and the cost of investment is going to be comparatively high but the returns can be handy considering the amount of migrations happening and the increase in jobs and comfort of living. These features should be added in a further study. Availability of water, the climatic conditions etc should also be considered in a further study. Cluster B is a soil for strategic investments seeing the growth potential Cluster B and Cluster C can yield better ROI in the long run seeing the comparatively lesser cost of investments. Finally the Cluster D should be considered for purchase of land which should be cheaper now and further developing them into residential parks in the long run.

Nikhil Kamath has launched a Quant PMS. It will use factor investing (such as momentum, earnings and value) to generate returns by frequently rebalancing the portfolio. The idea is not buy and hold. There can be portfolio churn of about 6 times a year

His flagship product True Beacon 1 has completed 3 years and given 22% CAGR, a bit above the Nifty's 19% before fees and taxes. However since it is a Cat III AIF, less volatile than Nifty.

Helping startups in fundraising, building pitch decks that can get investor meetings🚀💵| CA | Startup Financial Advisor | Valuation | Investment Banker | Ex-Deloitte M&A | Writes about startups, fund raising tips ✍🏻

Not everyone has a crystal ball to predict the future. But Y-Combinator's (YC) pitches can give us a sneak peek.
.
.
.
YC's ability to spot trends early makes it a successful early-stage backer.
 
They funded some path-breaking innovations such as AirBnb, Dropbox, Reddit, Coinbase, RazorPay, etc. when they were really small.
 
YC's latest batch has 220+ startups from across the world. Analysing them would give you a sneak peak of what entrepreneurs are building for our future.


Here's what I found:
 
[1] Though late-stage companies have cooled down, Fintech and Crypto are still hot.
 
- Every 5th company in the batch was fintech. 
- 11 startups are building neobanks (digital banks). 
- Indian startups are building neobanks for couples, for young professionals, for wholesalers. 
- Despite the batch size being 40% smaller than the previous one, there are more crypto startups in this one. Crypto winter? What Crypto winter?
 
[2] B2B/Enterprise Startups continue to dominate 
  
- Enterprise startups: ~40%
- Fintech : 20%
- Dev tools : ~13% (almost doubled)
- Consumer focused : ~9% (focus was on profitability / path to it)
- Not much representation for startups in the creator economy, despite the hype.
 
[3] Despite its huge potential, the No-code tool segment is still in need of a breakout. The batch indicates that the segment is surging.
 
...
 
My biggest takeaway from this cohort comes from Crypto startups. "Don't let externalities slow you down; Build, Build, Build"
 
What is your takeaway?

I migrated my website geektechblogs from wp.com to AWS Lightsail. wp.com does not allow you to have plugins unless you are in business plan which is pretty expensive. AWS Lightsail is secure, reliable and cost effective. There were a lot of moving pieces to it, so I have put together a blog which will give you all the steps required to transfer your domain to Route 53, create Hosted Zones, configure Lightsail instance, Enable Https and even briefly touched on ways to monetize your website with ads plugins.

Online media is full of talk about Byju's changing its revenue recognition. 

All this hoopla is about something as dumb as this: If a Byju's customer buys a 4-year package for Rs 1 lac, should Byju's recognize revenue of Rs 1 lac right away, or Rs 25k each for the next 4 years? 

Should it matter? What impact does it have on cash flow? 

Nothing. 

Then why do we care? If the VC and investor community's perception of value is influenced by how you recognize revenue, I think we have bigger things to worry about than Byju's losses.

Revenue recognition is just accounting. It means nothing. And yet, that is what companies are fretting about. 

We are doomed.

There's a thing about being a Gujju (Someone hailing from Gujarat).

You're eternally in '"a hurry". You want to finish that next bit of work as early as possible by proper planning and using maximum effective shortcuts possible. And may be then, plan a vacation or a social get-together in the days you saved by finishing that bit of work earlier than expected.

It’s interesting that when we talk about Teacher’s day, most of us associate it with our school or college days and the professors who taught us the lessons there. For me and most of the people I know, the source of knowledge never mattered. I have always believed in seeking knowledge from anywhere and everywhere, irrespective of who the ‘Guru’ is. And this helped me in finding and appreciating the Guru in ‘Einstein’ – My pet dog/First kid/Co-founder at www.TailBlaze.in 

I have tried to encapsulate my learnings from this amazing Guru in this blog.

#Funfact 
As per Guinness World Records,
The greatest reliable age recorded for a dog is 29 years 5 months for an Australian cattle-dog named Bluey, owned by Les Hall of Rochester, Victoria, Australia. Bluey was obtained as a puppy in 1910 and worked among cattle and sheep for nearly 20 years before being put to sleep on 14 November 1939.

An ancient Ayurveda proverb reads:
"If the diet is wrong, medicine if of no use. If the diet is correct, medicine is of no need."

TT18: India is still a patriarchal country | Decide on your brand's gender accordingly

In a recent episode of Koffee with Karan, I saw that 9 out of the Top 10 popular male actors in India currently are from the Southern neighbours of #Bollywood. The mass-consumed content in any country is a reflection of the core-identity of the country. And if we see the trends,movies like RRR, KGF have been rocking at the box-office with 1000s of crore of collections, a lot of that share coming from the Hindi-speaking audience. The storyline of these movies are so similar: A charismatic man who is the saviour, the messiah. There's also a trophy-female character in the movie who is the love interest of this macho man.The poor female has to sacrifice both the joys of her life and the screen-time, so that the MAN can save the World around them and also the Producer's money! Co-incidentally, the only actor from Bollywood in that Popular list is Akshay Kumar. No wonder, he himself plays very similar roles of being the man this society needs.

In that similar survey, 3 out of 10 actresses were from Bollywood and rest from their southern neighbours. Well done girls, you just outdid the boys from Bollywood.(Oops, sounded like a recent CBSE results announcement bulletin).Infact, the topper of the chart had to shun a few trophy-female roles in her industry and do a heroic role in a Hindi OTT - The Family Man Season 2 to get this fame. Well done lady.More power to you!

Bollywood has now become like Hollywood - 15 years back in India! It is not everyone's cup of tea now. Only a very few core/cream audience has sticked to it with it becoming more gender-equal in the last few years. Kudos to Alia, Katrina and Deepika for bringing this much needed change. Coincidentally, the most loved male actor by this sect is - Ranveer Singh, who is all about the colours, the loving energy and the flaunts which he carries on 'Paper' and in-person! It's nothing but a lot of beautiful feminine energy embodied in a muscular framework.Bollywood is no longer 'the masses game' as it used to be. We have seen some great and bold stories such as Thappad on screen. And, I personally can't wait for Jee Le Zaraa!

Now back to the headline. Take an example of just one industry: e-commerce. Think about all the mass brands and the energy they carry (the design, the UI, the experience, the core identity). 
Amazon - Simple UI, Gets the work done, no nonsense. That's so much of a 'male' gender/energy. And no wonder, it's a mass #ecommerce player! 
CRED - The design, the screenflows, the experience gives a female zing to it. No wonder it is not designed for the masses.
Zepto - Shuns the 2-genders concept. Experience of a feminine zing in a male-like boring q-commerce industry.
Can you now relate and think of more examples like this? Do share in the comments! But the big lesson is - #brands will have to decide on their genders depending on whom they want to cater to!

The Government of India established International Financial Services Centres Authority (IFSC) in April 2020 under the International Financial Services Centres Authority Act passed by the Indian Parliament.

For the first time, the regulatory powers of four financial services regulators in India, namely, Reserve Bank of India (RBI), Securities & Exchange Board of India (SEBI), Insurance Regulatory Development Authority of India (IRDAI), Pension Fund Regulatory Development Authority of India (PFRDAI), have been vested in IFSCA with respect to regulation of financial institutions, financial services and financial products in the IFSC, making it a unified regulator for the International Financial Services Centre in India.

Approved by the Government of India as an International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) at GIFT City,Gandhinagar , the IFSC reinforces India’s strategic position as a global hub for financial services. Apart from providing a global financial platform, it provides easy access to the Indian economy, which is amongst the largest and fastest-growing economies in the world and connects ~30 million strong Indian diaspora globally to India through the IFSC.

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), the regulator of the capital markets in India, earlier in June 2021 issued guidelines for off-market transfer of securities by FPIs to IFSC.

For relocation, an FPI or its wholly-owned special purpose vehicle may approach its Designated Depository Participants (DDP) for approval of a 'one-time off-market' transfer of its securities to the 'resultant fund'. SEBI noted that tax incentives are provided for relocating foreign funds to IFSC under the Finance Act, 2021, in order to make the IFSC in GIFT City, Gujarat, a global financial hub. DDPs after appropriate due diligence may accord their approval for a one-time off-market transfer of securities for such relocation.

What is Foreign Portfolio Investment?

Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI) consists of securities and other financial assets held by investors in another country. It does not provide the investor with direct ownership of a company's assets and is relatively liquid depending on the volatility of the market. Portfolio investment involves the making and holding of a hands-off or passive investment of securities, done with the expectation of earning a return. In foreign portfolio investment, these securities can include stocks, American depositary receipts (ADRs), or global depositary receipts of companies headquartered outside the investor's nation. Holding also includes bonds or other debt issued by these companies or foreign governments, mutual funds, or Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) that invest in assets abroad or overseas. The persons/ institutions investing money through this route are called Foreign Portfolio Investors.

What are Off-Market Transactions?

An off-market transaction is settled between two parties on mutually agreed terms and the clearing corporation or the stock exchange is not involved. These include legacy transfers, gifts, transfer of shares between two Demat accounts, shifting of securities between a client and a sub-broker, and transactions in unlisted securities. One party is the transferor, while the other is the transferee. 

GIFT City, the country's first international financial services centre (IFSC), on Monday said it has collaborated with the India InsurTech Association (IIA) to promote financial technology in the Insurance sector.IIA is a not-for-profit organisation working towards growing a technology-driven insurance ecosystem in India.

The two entities will collaborate on building thought leadership in the field of insurance and creating awareness about  Gift City among Indian and foreign insurance companies. The Association will promote new digital business models, build collaboration between start-ups and all the other participants of the insurance industry.

GIFT City, India's obstacle-free gateway to the world of exotic and complex global finance, has gained sufficient traction in the past two years to achieve what was considered improbable a decade ago, with tweaks to existing rules helping the facility rival global hubs and draw business that was earlier only an overseas monopoly.

The number of entities surged to around 260 until August across the special economic zone this year from 140 in 2019, with banking transactions crossing the $100 billion mark in July. It is only set to accelerate with the likes of Deutsche, HSBC, Citigroup, Bank of America, Standard Chartered and Barclays opening up offices to facilitate rising Indian trade and capital movement.

The bread that you ordered online from Grofers or Milkbasket, was in turn ordered by them, from their distributor through a procurement platform. The distributor too ordered the bread from the manufacturer online – perhaps an email or perhaps through some procurement software. Either way the units were tracked, taxes were paid, records were captured and later fed into the accounting system.

The manufacturer however ordered the flour for the bread not online but in all likelihood via a phone call, from the aata wholesaler. The aata wholesaler probably called the consolidator at the mandi who purchased directly from the farmer. No online records are needed for they have been buying from each other for decades. Records are kept on small paper chits and then tallied weekly or monthly or whenever some settlement is needed.

This is Asia’s largest Jeera (cumin seed) market at Unjha, Gujarat. Purchases happen via handshakes, phone calls and records are kept on paper chits.

It is not just the traditional methods of transacting – offline, nontransparent and inefficient – that impact the agricommodity market. The entire system is riddled with inefficiencies, e.g., the lack of standardization in food grading means that you are forced to rely on the same supplier lest the trial and error impact your product event it means higher prices. The small size of farm holdings means multiple intermediaries to buy it, sort the produce and then it, all of which mean a more elongated and expensive supply chain. It is estimated these add as much as 10% additional costs – ~$50b or so, to the $482b agricommodity market, all of which pass on to us, the consumers.

Gaurav, Sumit and the Procol team want to change that. They are rethinking the future of the agricommodity supply chain in India, with a view to make it transparent, efficient and online.

They have started their journey at the highest leverage point for technology in the agricommodity supply chain – procurement. Their enterprise platform Agribid helps companies such as Future Group, Bikanerwala and others order and purchase commodities through a transparent auction. The presence of larger companies helps attract their thousands of suppliers aboard who begin now to get the benefits of scale. Along with procurement, Procol is gradually adding other components including invoice generation, transportation, tracking, grading and credit to work towards a complete marketplace offering.

Blume is excited to partner with Gaurav, Sumit and the Procol team in their journey to restructure the agricommodity procurement stack. Our agritech thesis spotted a large opportunity in the post-harvest go to market space / agri marketplace segment, and we have been exploring this for a while. But in venture investing, the market size and opportunity come second. What comes first is the team. And it is when Gaurav met us and shared the Procol opportunity, that we committed to go all in!

Gaurav and Sumit just before their YC interview in 2018, which sadly didn’t go their way.

Gaurav and Sumit met at Zomato, and stayed in touch, even as they moved on to different roles (Gaurav to TableHero, Sumit to OYO) bouncing off entrepreneurial ideas and passion projects of each other – first a gamified stock trading site, then a blue collar jobs site and then finally Procol (procurement protocol). They bring together strong product orientation, terrific business + financial insight (not always seen in tech founders) and a passion and hunger to leave a dent in the universe, all in all a rare trifecta of skills and orientation, that we just knew we had to back.

Gaurav and Sumit symbolize the new wave of fearless domestic B2B entrepreneurs we are beginning to see in India, building India-first or even India-only ventures – Udaan, RazorPay, Instamojo, Ninjacart, Khatabook and so on. Unlike the first wave of the B2B entrepreneurs who saw India as a springboard to the West (Zoho, Freshworks, GreyOrange, DataWeave etc), this new breed is seeing a large opportunity in the Indian B2B marketplace – thanks to advances in technology (smartphone, cheap bandwidth) and formalization (Aadhar, GST).

We are excited to back the future of agricommodity procurement. We are excited to back Gaurav, Sumit and the Procol team.

The earliest human civilizations developed around waterbodies be it Egyptian or Indus valley civilizations. These settlements would have been difficult without water, which was essential for both agriculture and drinking. Rivers also served as a means of transportation between settlements, facilitating trade and the development of banking and other services.

Once humans mastered the art of transporting water the second phase of development happened around cities that are well connected through various modes of transportation. the next phase of development will happen around cities that are planned in terms of infrastructure and have a laid-out plan for business policies and incentives which will help businesses prosper and generate employment and is well connected to business centers.

A city that qualifies on all these parameters is GIFT City Gandhinagar, developed around seven kilometers from Gandhinagar, Gujarat's capital, on the banks of the Sabarmati River in an area of approximately 886 acres, what was once barren land along the river is now emerging as the country's first greenfield integrated city — a dream project Prime Minister Narendra Modi had envisioned as Gujarat's Chief Minister.

The GIFT City (Gujarat International Finance Tec-City) is India's first and only IFSC (International Financial Services Centre) where banks, stock exchanges, and financial services firms have set up their global operations. It is now operational with more than 200 entities.

GIFT City is all set to become ‘The Finance & Technology Gateway Of India For The World’ by offering world-class infrastructure to attract top talent in the country. The prime focus of GIFT City is- to target 8-10% of financial services potential in India and create 1 million direct & indirect jobs. At GIFT City, the entire development is divided into four zones Commercial Zone, Residential Zone, and Institutional Zone. All this qualifies GIFT city as one of the best investment destination in Gujarat.

Gujaratis are considered to be an उत्सव-प्रिय (festival loving) community. Our calendar years begin with the celebration of #Uttarayan (#MakarSankranti), the festival of #kites. Members of my community are also considered to be the movers and shapers of stock markets in the country. I try and narrate a few lessons that I learnt regarding the stock markets from the festival of Uttarayan-

Sustained presence of wind is an extremely important component for the festival of Uttarayan to be enjoyed wholeheartedly. On a few festival days, the wind is in abundance while on other occasions, it is scarce beyond frustration. On an average out of the four sessions (morning-evening) on the 14-15th of every January, there is at least a presence of any two forms of wind phases- High, Medium & Low Wind. These differing phases typify the Bullish and Bearish trends in stock markets. Depending on these three phases, the following observations come to my mind-

'बहुत हवा है यार आज तो' phase

- Notwithstanding the fundamentals of a particular company's scrip, there is a certain sense of 'feel-good' in the market during a bullish phase. It tends to bringing the irregular investors (trying to make a quick buck) into the stock-markets too. One can go and check stock market numbers before the Reliance Power IPO in early 2008 to get a feel of the same. Nearly every kind of scrip has the ability to make money, operator-run scrips make hay while the sun shines and intra-day trading tend to reach an all-time high.

- This is the phase which exhibits abundance of wind thereby making kite-flying easier. One needs to only give a push (thumka) to the kite when it is placed in an apt direction and the wind does the rest of the work. This phase witnesses almost all the participants on the terrace coming into the picture. The selfie-generation youngsters, who were till now glued to their snapchat and Instagram accounts, sometimes suo-moto while sometimes on being coaxed by their parents, show some intent to pursue kite-flying too. All kind of kites, without proper knot tied (kinya) or one without proper knot-balancing (sun-sun) and in some cases, when some auteurs decide to fly even the partially torn kites, they all fly far and high.

'हवा कहाँ है यार' phase

- This is the phase when the bears take over. The investors tend to lose money and in the process, the non-serious investors are the first ones to take a flight out of the markets. Foreign Investors, only there in the country, to make a quick-buck follow the suit. Full-time investors use this time to take a stock of their investments and learn lessons for the future. One tends to only restrict their monies to the blue-chip or the set of companies with the strongest fundamentals in the market. They also tend to find other avenues such as gold, real-estate, commodities to park their money till they find the markets more conducive to further invest.

- Similarly, the wind sometimes just suddenly disappears during Uttarayan. In a few cases, the Meteorological Department already announces like Dr. Rajan that a crisis in the form of lack of wind is impending. The 'mentally-not-fully'-kite flyers' community are the first ones to make this an excuse and get back to their phones and tablets. Only the lightest, the most nimble and balanced kites, if one decides to fly, must be used in such cases. The real connoisseurs also tend to invest this opportunity to experiment, teach kids and the ones intending to learn the art of kite-flying by using the time to show them the related practical aspects of kite-flying sans the actual process. They also tend to find alternate means to invest their time by joining their family members in playing cards and in case, if there are enough takers, cricket on the terrace.

'इतनी तो हवा है, और कितनी चाहिए?' phase

- This is the phase which exhibits the scenario of near perfect competition in the #StockMarkets. With balanced set of winds (good-news- positive economy numbers, economic performance, global headwinds etc.) flowing intermittently, one can afford to lose any chance especially towards the end of the day. There is a need for a certain amount of effort in the beginning but once the scrip crosses a certain threshold (meets a desired/expected objective), things take off. There are enough chances to gain arbitrage by making informed risk-taking decisions where the investor is confident about his/her investment decision.

- In a colony with equal sized flats counting in over a couple of dozens, nearly every terrace gives you an opportunity to fly and cut as many kites in the phase of balanced wind. One must not lose any opportunity to fly kites as during the end of the day as at this time, everyone is jostling for that one inch of space on the terrace to fly the kite. Hence, the rush during this period, makes the Darwin's theory come into the picture; the one who is the most adaptable to change- keeps his kites fly-ready, picks the most suitable side of the terrace to fly kites, ends up enjoying the most. There will be extra rush and hence, in the initial phase, one must not get frustrated and keep patience. Once you are out of the initial clutter, the results will follow. :)

And last but not the least,

Sentiment is an extremely important factor that determines how stock markets perform especially in a shorter run. For example, look at the stock market numbers during those 15-odd minutes when Congress took lead during the counting of Gujarat Election Results 2017. It all depends on which party is perceived by the markets to be more conducive for the nation at any given point of time and this perception is what drives the sentiment.

Similarly the sentiment during a particular Uttarayan is very important. During this year's Uttarayan (14th), there was a perception of lack of wind. More so, there were messages from several other areas that there is an absence of a proper amount of wind. Being on terrace for nearly a third of the first session (1 hour) and the entire second session, I can vouch that there was enough air to be considered for the third phase however the narrative being the opposite, many did not really venture out until it was the final hour of the evening.

As a community, we thrive on taking risks and in attempting great things. Nearly everything that can teach us, we try and derive lessons from the same. Then may it be traveling in the Third Class in Indian Railways or flying kites in the first class atmosphere of Gujarat during Uttarayan, we are a lot more than just a traders' community. 

Aavjo. :)

Disclaimer: This is not professional investment advice and should not be construed as such. I may or may not have holdings in these investment ideas.

Some thoughts on where you could seek and find value in these turbulent times for Indian equity investors. These are some secondary equity market themes which are ideas that I think are worth sharing for a long term investment. These are NOT stock trading ideas.

As India's Nifty (Index) approaches its key support around 10K these are some buy on dips for accumulation moves one could consider as part of a portfolio in the coming weeks.

City Gas Distribution - Gasification (pipeline distribution) if you will of our urban sprawls in Tier-1, Tier-2 cities is still nascent, capital intensive and should yield results long term (based on the US deployment and eventual formation of giant utilities - that offer the highest dividend yields till date). 1 crore piped natural gas users by 2020 is the mandate, a massive 45 lakh connections will have to be given in one year to accomplish this, per last years reports.

This is 10+ year horizon investment that could not only be a good equity investment but also offer annuity income.

Investment options in this space are Mahanagar Gas, GAIL, IGL and Gujarat Gas.

Consumption - Indian's love to eat out, spend and make merry no matter what plagues the world. That is just a cultural phenomena, with disposable incomes at an all time high and a ever ballooning youth population, within the broad consumption theme expect select consumerism (food specifically) driven companies to offer stable returns.

Some ideas here are contrarian like ITC which has been pummeled, however it is a value play for the long term investor in my view.

Investment options in this space are Heritage Foods, LT Foods, Marico and ITC.

Road Infrastructure - Tollization is the wave, select players in this domain are cash flow positive with a strong management team and there are also indirect avenues to invest in this via InvITs (REITs for Infrastructure) giving high yields.

Investment options in this space are Dilip Buildcon, IRB InvIT and PNC Infra.

Pharma - Despite the broader sector being hostage to USFDA surprise and frequent inspections and reports, pockets in this sector provide the much needed cushion for a portfolio in such volatile times. I like hybrid pharma firms like Cadila (which have a consumer facing play) and well as specialized plays given the future of Biosimilars (nine drugs in the biologics category have either gone off patent or will do so by 2025)

Investment options in this space are Biocon (28-30% revenue from Biosimilars), Glenmark and Aurobindo.

Mobility - The electrification of mobility brings us a once in a lifetime opportunity to make hay.....while they charge. Public transportation and Commercial Vehicles will adopt en mass driven by policy, two wheeler EV adoption will outpace 10x, in the consumer segment in my view.

Investment options in this space are TVS Motors and Ashok Leyland (like the future here a lot).

SIN stocks (alcohol, gambling) do well in tough times, however I am not convinced about their balance sheets and management teams at this point. Globus Spirits and Delta could be options here for those willing to take a bet, pun intended.

I have been trading equities and derivatives since my teens, technical charting and trading skills honed over time, however when it comes to investing have never adopted a buy and hold strategy and the only "Buffet" I know is "Lunch Buffet". Hence please take my views with dollop of salt and consult a professional financial adviser. Then you might deploy a portfolio/basket strategy commensurate with your risk appetite.

Happy Investing, please do share your views and feedback in the comments.

In the last 12 months, regulations monitoring restructuring in India have gone through a sea change. These have far reaching impact. It is finally the beginning of the development of the distressed investment market in India. For investors and professionals equally exciting times are ahead. Through this article I do not intend to summarize all the changes, instead I want to present my point of view on what to expect going forward. Here are the 7 key trends that I anticipate -

 As ARCs transition from agency model to investor model they will go through internal re-organization and add capabilities that will be necessary to make them successful in the new environment. I suspect some ARCs will not survive this change but many more will come into the market with a sharper focus and capabilities.

 The mechanism to acquire NPAs will gradually shift towards cash acquisition instead of issuance of security receipts. Having said that the Finance Minister in his Budget 2017 has allowed listing and trading of security receipts issued by ARCs in SEBI registered stock exchanges. This is a significant step as it will gradually provide exit options to the investors. It will further lead to development of secondary market for such securities.

 Through the incorporation of Insolvency and Bankruptcy code Government made it clear that it is serious about changing the restructuring regime in India which was marred by old, outdated and fragmented laws. However I expect the laws to further evolve and gradually move towards adopting the cross-border restructuring regime as well as aligning the SARFAESI and the new Bankruptcy code. Budget 2017 has stated that a bill related to resolution mechanism will be introduced shortly that will further strengthen these regulations.

 In this regard it is worth noting two key provisions introduced by Budget 2017 –

 Further Finance Minister has also provided INR 10,000 crores for recapitalization of Banks in 2017-18. Additional allocation will be provided as may be required. All of the above measures will provide additional incentives to the Banks to recognize NPAs timely. Further the tax structure relating to ARCs will continue to simplify further.

 While all the changes are focused on enabling creditor driven regime however to ensure successful outcomes I expect the ‘Debtors’ to take proactive measures and timely recognize issues that have impacted the business. In this regard we will gradually see development of pre-packs strategy in India.

 This is going to be an outcome of all the changes that have now begun to take place. In the next 24 to 36 months we will see a vibrant distressed investment market and this eventually will add to the GDP growth as so far many businesses that could have been saved, failed due to lack of proper infrastructure.

 Historically the primary focus has been on balance sheet restructuring. However with the evolving regulations and anticipated increase in FDIs into ARCs and Security receipts the focus on operational turnaround will gain significant importance. The listing of security receipts will provide additional incentive to turnaround companies.

There is a systematic disruption happening in this field and players who identify this disruption and adopt suitable strategies early on will lead.

Falguni Nayar, the former investment banker who founded Nykaa in April 2012 at the age of 50, became one of India’s 20 richest people on Wednesday after FSN E-commerce Ventures, Nykaa’s parent firm, made a blockbuster debut on the stock exchanges. 

Fortune: Nayar, only the second Indian self-made woman billionaire after Biocon founder Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw, was worth around Rs 5.56 lakh crore ($7.48 billion) as of 3.10 pm on Wednesday, when FSN’s stock was at Rs 2,206 a share. She owns 53.5% of the company through two promoter trusts and seven other promoter entities. 

This made her the 17th richest person in India, ahead of Ashwin Dani, non-executive chairman of Asian Paints Ltd ($7.05 billion) and behind Wadia Group chairman Nusli Wadia ($8.4 billion), according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

Gujarat International Finance Tec-City is a planned business district in Ahmedabad, Gujarat. The city was conceptualized in 2009, recognizing the potential of the state as an emerging IT and Financial Services hub.

Today, after more than a decade, the city - India’s one of a kind - remains a patchwork of state-of-the-art facilities & under-construction centers. Today, the city is struggling to answer questions relating to its existence and operations at full capacity.

The GIFT Special Economic Zone targets business segments like offshore banking, capital markets, offshore insurance, offshore asset management, IT and BPO services along with ancillary services.

Despite the fact that it is located in India, it is considered an offshore jurisdiction for most regulatory purposes. This means that most local laws, like tariffs and other regulations, don’t apply (just like Singapore) and facilitate capital flows without any restrictions.

A freely convertible currency, low tax regimes, minimal regulations and speedy dispute regulation is what a foreign investor looks for. This is exactly what helped Singapore to become one of the top three financial hubs in the world. India’s GIFT city draws inspiration from its Asian friend and aspires to become a world class central business hub.

GIFT is India's first operational smart city and International Financial Services Centre (IFSC). It received a dozen proposals in April 2021 despite the economic slowdown caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. Recent proposals include Singapore Stock Exchange’s first subsidiary in India and five fund management entities including DSP Asset Managers, Kedaara Capital and Rising Fintech among others.

India is planning to adopt Singapore's Variable Capital Company (VCC) model for investment funds at the International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) in the GIFT City with a separate legislation that is not part of the Companies Act, 2013. Singapore’s VCC aims to provide flexibility by facilitating fund operations and catering to the needs of global funds, reap economies of scale, achieve cost efficiencies and facilitate re-domiciliation.

GIFT officials are deliberating on the new structure that aims to enable effective segregation and ring-fencing of different pools of assets, the ability to issue different classes of shares, altering fund’s capital structure without regulatory approvals, the freedom to choose accounting standards for different funds with varied characteristics and the ability to wind up quickly. The viability of the factors is yet to be assessed fully.

The latest Global Financial Centres Index, London, dated September 2020 already places IFSC at GIFT City right at the top amongst 15 centers globally, which are likely to gain greater significance in the next 24 months.

In the Union Budget 2021, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman reaffirmed the government’s commitment to develop the IFSC at GIFT City. 

In addition to the tax incentives already provided, the FM proposed a slew of measures:

Radhika Bajoria  Definitely his achievements are remarkable . Most important thing is he identified the opportunities and made full use of it for his benifits. That's what may people lack. They know the opportunities but does not use that. It's the risk reward ratio which one needs to identify and take action on it. The Big Boy Toyz Ltd  is one such example which  Jatin Ahuja  had identified looking at the craze for cars which people had and use it to the best of his benifit. Tough there are so many dealers which provides such services but the trust and quality of service which the company provides has created a goodwill in the market. Tough the situation has worsen a bit in this pandemic but the craze for cars is not going to end and the business model is going to succeed going forward and the aims which Jatin Ahuja  has will be achieved .

I still remember when BBT was opened in 2009 on MG road, Delhi, it was on my way to my office and back. Always used to think who the owner is. Always had an impression that it was being run by a man with a lot of money. But when I read about  Jatin Ahuja, the self made man who with his hard work dedication modesty and focused vision has made this brand, I was very inspired. I give his example in my trainings as well.. Kudos to u sir....

What would you choose at Rs 999 - a clothing piece or a flight ticket?

A tricky question that quickly triggers your mind into questioning your needs. That’s what Cleartrip’s ad did in the newspaper today morning.

A smart way of attracting people to check out their travel offers by comparing it with a normal purchases of a #customer. 

Out of all the current festive season sale ads, Cleartrip’s ad in TOI today is the most engaging, witty & neatly presented. 

Selling commodities is like selling your phone or a car to a second hand buyer. But selling #travel is like selling your house, a much difficult task unless at attractive prices.

What do you think can be other creative ways to sell travel to customers? Thoughts?

The face behind the Indian IT boom, the man who introduced Aadhar Cards in India & a visionary who touched the sky with Infosys- here’s how Nandan Nilekani became the God of India’s tech.

After his graduation from IIT Bombay, Nandan started working with Patni Computers in 1978.

Post that, he was interviewed by the Infosys founder, Narayan Murthy to join his founding team. 

In 1981, he & five other employees left Patni Computers to start Infosys. He became the CEO in 2002 after holding positions of a COO, MD, & President. 

He left Infosys in 2009 to become the chairman of UIDAI (Unique Identification Authority of India), an administration cabinet ranking position. 

Wondering how he did that?
He was invited by then Prime Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh to lead UIDAI.

And during his tenure as #chairman, he implemented the Aadhar to help the government create the population database digitally. 

This project launched by him was also called “The Biggest Social Project on the Planet” as it got 1.14 bn people registered to the system!

• From tech to politics:

Nandan had also tried contesting in the 2014 Lok Sabha Elections. 

He had joined Indian National Congress Party from the Bangalore South constituency.

This tech #billionaire’s assets worth Rs 7710 cr (as was filed with the election commission) had made him the wealthiest candidate in the 2014 Lok Sabha election.

But with Modi coming in power, he lost the seat to a BJP candidate.

• The billionaire’s give back:

In 2017, him & his wife pledged to #donate more than 50% of their total wealth to the “Giving Pledge” movement, organized by Bill Gates. 

He is also the chairman of EkStep, a not-for-profit to improve basic literacy for millions of children in India. 

Currently he is working with PM Modi on developing a #tech to compete with Amazon, & also running the fundamentum partnership which raised $227 mn for its second fund. It has two unicorns in its portfolio- Pharmeasy and Spinny. 

Nandan saw the future of internet & tech much before any other global player. 

Who do you think has the same forward looking mindset in our Indian startup ecosystem today?

Did you know the largest marine oil spill in the world had caused bp to pay $65 billion in 2010?

In a bid to do cost cutting, BP took risks that costed them much more. The fee was broken down into,

1. criminal and civil penalties
2. natural resource damages
3. economic and social claims
4. cleanup costs

With 800 mn litres of oil being released into the Gulf of Mexico, the fire not only destroyed BP’s physical property but also destroyed shareholder #wealth. 

From April 19, 2010, to June 25, 2010, BP’s share price came down by 55% after this Deepwater Horizon incident! 

After the spill, the U.S. Environment Protection Agency had #banned BP from bidding for new work in the Gulf of Mexico and supplying fuel to the military. The ban was however lifted after 4 years, in March 2014.

Today, BP is doing great as if this incident never happened. It is one of the strongest investment bets as per Bloomberg as it is focused on returning capital to #shareholders with a recent share buyback announcement, worth $3.5 bn. 

Do you know of any other such multibillion dollar environmental corporate crimes?

Thrilled to have yesterday spoken with teenagers wanting to become entrepreneurs at an event organised by Ryan International School, Malad West, Mumbai and WHITE CANVAS INDIA  

Passing out of school 7 years back, never knew that I would get to address school students at 23. 

The level of creativity, energy & zest that these 14-15 year old students had for their business plans is unbeatable. 

Clearly, the future of #entrepreneurship in India is in great hands & initiatives like Young CEO program & boot camps give a boost to students wanting to startup early.

Where do you think are we headed with teenage entrepreneurship in India?

P.S.: Some of them were so well aware that they even knew of the investors in Ryan International education group :)

From the founders leaving their own startup, to it facing a financial crisis in 2019 to one of the investors becoming the CEO of the startup - here’s how Coverfox Insurance became the 2nd largest integrated platform for insurance in India.

Just as most insurance companies, selling via call centers & pushing products down the customer’s throat was Coverfox's strategy.

However, with an impressive #tech, the startup had managed to raise a total of Rs 385 cr but it failed to keep up its promise to investors who were waiting for a good bottomline!

Their earlier business model failed as it relied only on paid leads with 1000+ callers focused on sales for top line growth. With this, the startup's previous team lost sight of the runway and cash burn.

• Result? 

~ It only generated Rs 5 Cr in #revenue against a cash burn of Rs 10.25 Cr monthly, on an average!!

With this, the whole management team was changed and restructured. Investors were losing confidence but one of their investors Sanjib Jha became the interim CEO considering insurtech in India is poised to become a $13 bn mkt by 2026. He was joined by Piyush Ranjan (CTO), Manish Sultania (CFO) & John Mayne (group business head)
 
• How did the new management change the fate of Coverfox Group?

1. Sanjib turned it around to make it gross #profitable & the second largest integrated web aggregator with over 375 insurance products in the span of just 18 months.
 
Till date directly and through its technology platform, Coverfox cumulatively has sold over Rs 1250 cr + worth of premium.
 
2. Leveraging the superior technology for further penetration into the Indian insurance market, CoverStAck the technology arm of the group was formed. 
 
With its vision of making insurance available for the wider digital population using the power of technology, Coverstack has partnered with 22+ clients & has generated premiums worth over Rs 20 Cr in the last 4 months. 
 
Adding a full-fledged technology business to their portfolio resulted in their revenues to grow 6x along with significant reduction in cash burn.
 
#pivoting at the right time with the right team ensures a startup's survival in a highly competitive market. Agree?

Did you know that all of ROLEX’s profits goes in charity because it is owned by a NGO?

The most luxurious watch company which produces ~2000 watches per day & was the only Swiss watch brand to have sales of CHF 5 bn +, precisely a revenue of CHF 8 bn in 2021 (Rs 67,400 cr) is owned by Hans Wilsdorf Foundation. 

• Was it always an NGO? No.

Upon the death of Hans’ wife in 1944, he established a Foundation in his name, dumped all of his shares there to make sure all income from the Rolex goes to the foundation.

Not just Rolex, but some of the world’s most famous brands are owned by non-profit organizations. Some of them include:

1. Wikipedia – Owned by the Wikimedia Foundation.

2. Mozilla Firefox – Owned by the Mozilla Foundation.

3. National Geographic Channel – Owned by the National Geographic Society (25%) & 21st Century Fox (75%)

4. TED – Owned by the Sapling Foundation

Do you know of other such companies where the profits go fully for charity? 
Why do you think are they owned by NGOs and not companies?

Lido becomes yet another edtech startup to file for bankruptcy!

Before Lido, not one or two, but three other #edtech startups have crashed to the level of filing for insolvency.

• Why is this the case with edtech only in 2022?

1) It is a sector that grew too fast, too soon during the #pandemic. Once the shutters to the world opened, the shutters of these startup shops shut.

• How?

~ Repoening of schools resulted in a huge drop in the number of children enrolling on the online platforms. 

~ This turned the tables for #startups who had to refund their customer fees, and were unable to pay their debts & salaries to the employees. 

One reason why we saw most edtech startups joining the #layoff bandwagon was due to economic downturn and funding drought.

In case of Lido, it tried to survive through a potential M&A when Reliance was in talks to acquire them.

But,
• Customers walking off >>> Mounting losses

Losses can be repaired but once a customer is lost, it’s lost forever. Hence Reliance backed out leaving the Ronnie Screwvala backed Lido in deep trouble. 

Lido Learning is India’s fourth edtech startup to shut operations in 2022 after,

1. Udayy: Which fortunately had some reserves to #refund the money to all customers and pay a generous severance to their team members and teachers. 

So much so, they also helped almost 100% of their employees get into new jobs & are returning the remaining capital to the investors. 

2. SuperLearn: Due to a #funding crunch, they couldn’t survive. Plus their growth stagnated post pandemic.

3. Crejo.Fun: It got so bad with them that they were even looking sell the IP and the product to return investor money.

Funding crunch can still be overcomed but if #growth stops, no one can save a sinking ship.

If BYJUs fails in the edtech market, do you think we will see more investors pull out of the edtech ecosystem?

Why do you think is the edtech market amongst all, facing such bad headwinds?

How the so-called 'female Steve Jobs' in Silicon Valley committed one of the world's biggest startup frauds and misused $700 mn VC money.

Theranos' founder Elizabeth Holmes witnessed a soaring rise with an ambition to revolutionise blood testing only to see a shocking fall with a label of being a '#criminal'.

What pushed Theranos to the skies was a testing technology that required only a drop of blood. But the same tech also pushed them straight underground as the startup got buried when it was revealed that incorrect test results were given to patients!! 

Theranos constantly lied to their board members about the #technology that repeatedly failed quality assurance. The whole company was built on lies!

• How did this startup even start?

~ It was founded in 2003 by the 19-year-old Elizabeth Holmes, a Stanford dropout who used her tuition money to build Theranos.

At its peak in 2014, when Elizabeth was just 30, Theranos raised $700 mn at a $10 bn valuation on a promise to break through the then $70 bn blood #testing market.

Their blood-testing startup pitch was flying high in the Silicon Valley as they claimed to conduct 200+ tests ranging from the basic cholesterol levels to complex genetic analysis, with just a single pinprick of blood.

• The company had become the rising star of Silicon Valley but then what happened?

~ The technology didn’t work!

• How was this revealed?

~ Through a #whistleblower named John who disclosed that Theranos was not using its own tech to conduct tests due to its inefficiency. (His investigation is today an award winning book named, "Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup".)

Elizabeth didn't stay quiet! She outrightly denied everything John said & even threatened to sue him.

But when the FDA & FBI #investigation was carried out, nothing could remain hidden.

In 2018, Theranos declared it is shutting down. They couldn't find a buyer for obvious reasons & their last $700 mn raise came in as a rescue to give cash back to their creditors.

Elizabeth, who wanted to change the world with a revolutionising tech, changed her own world by committing a serious #fraud as she was severely punished with a 20 year jail sentence recently in Jan'22.

This fraud that sent shock waves across Silicon Valley is also documented in a TV series called, 'The Dropout', & even got covered on the big screen with the movie named, 'The Inventor: Out for Blood in Silicon Valley'.

The biggest learning from this scandal: Don't ride the valuation hype train & investigate each startup thoroughly before pumping in money. Agree? What do you think are the other learnings?

How a journalist who started with just Rs 50,000 in 1993 built Network18 into India's largest media empire from a small production company, and just got 3 days to decide if he wants to stay in his own company.

Amidst the news of Adani taking over NDTV, a similar yet more painful event was seen when Raghav Bahl revealed to the Network18 board that Reliance was taking over!

Raghav Bahl had two options when RIL decided to takeover:

1. Lose #control of the media company which he grew for 21 years and become a salaried employee (managing director with an annual salary of Rs 20 cr)
2. Simply quit, which Raghav did!

When RIL spent ₹ 4,000 cr to take complete control of Network18, it was declared as the biggest takeover in India’s #media industry.

• The backstory:

In 2012, Mukesh Ambani’s RIL gave loan in the form of convertible debentures to Network18’s promoter group companies. These were convertible into shares at any time within 10 years. 

Smartly enough, Mukesh Ambani decided to convert after it two-and-a-half years itself as Network18 reduced their losses with the help of the #loan.

The deal was fair but unexpected for Raghav. 

• But why did RIL act in a hurry to takeover?

1. He wanted to get a hold on the gas pricing affair & ensure that nothing goes against him in the media. 

2. He had plans to #takeover the telecom industry with Jio & needed a content factory with 100% control.

Today, RIL has access to all the content put out by the Network18 Group such as,

IBNlive, Moneycontrol, Firstpost, Cricketnext, Homeshop18, bookmyshow, and TV channels such as Colors, CNBC TV18, CNN-IBN, IBN7 and CNBC Awaaz.

And Raghav Bahl went onto to create yet another media powerhouse, ‘Quint’.

Do you think #monopolization of media (now with NDTV) will create lesser space for smaller and differing voices?

Indian founders can now get the best #valuations anywhere in the world without the fear of ‘round-tripping’ as startups can now freely flip their business to access global capital!

How?
~ The central government and the RBI have declared that round-tripping structures do not require #approval from the RBI, given that there is not more than two levels of subsidiaries.

So, is it really an exciting news?
~ For those who flip structures for money laundering by creating subsidiaries all over the world - no! xD
~ For those who genuinely do round tripping for business - yes!

Tech #startups, opting for the overseas direct investment route (ODI) will now see expansion in M&A/ PE activity as the RBI has also allowed investment or disinvestment by an investor, who is under investigation in India, without any approval.

- For investors,
1. The biggest relief: Indian LPs have now been allowed to invest in offshore PE/ VC funds directly without #regulatory approvals. 

Similarly, Indian GPs can now pool funds in GIFT City from domestic and international LPs to invest in Indian/ offshore targets without approvals.

2. VCs & AIFs can now invest in securities (debt/equity) of companies incorporated outside India, even if the investee company has no Indian connection. 

3. SEBI has increased the limit for investors to reinvest their proceeds in foreign companies. Its is now $1.5 bn, up from $750 mn until 2021. This limit might also go up to $3 bn as SEBI is in discussion with RBI.

Startups expand based on subsidiaries in new markets, and the new ODI regulations open up a lot of opportunities. Join us in our webinar today as we discuss about it. 
Registration link: https://lnkd.in/daja5yuG

P.S: Study material on the latest ODI rules (credits: Resolüt Partners): https://lnkd.in/dXq4ckm8

Do you think with these new rules, we will see more Indian funds in GIFT & founders getting active with acquisitions? (BYJUs will be the happiest given their acquisition spree :))

Widely used indicator by traders but with a lesser understanding of what it reflects and how it should be analysed.

In this thread:

Moving Average (MA) is a statistical calculation used to analyse a different subset of the full data set. In technical analysis, MA is used as an indicator to help us analyse stock by smoothing out the price data by creating a constantly updated average price.

By calculating the moving average, the impacts of random, short-term fluctuations on the price of a stock over a specified time frame are mitigated.

A simple moving average (SMA) is a calculation that takes the arithmetic mean of a given set of prices over the specific number of days in the past; for example, over the previous 21, 50, 89, or 200 days. For example, Formula of 21-SMA = (P1+P2+….P21)/21

EMA is a weighted average -gives greater importance to the price of an asset in more recent days, making an indicator that is more responsive to new information. In trading, we generally tend to use EMA instead of SMA for better trading decisions.

Typically, MA is plotted using Closing Price. We can also consider other data sets. For instance, high or low value. As we have understood from the formula, for calculation, we need only one data point. MA is a good indicator to identify the Area of Value.

If plotted with closing price, it signifies the Avg buying price of a particular asset. This gives you a probable action area and what you should expect from the stock if it visits again. For inherently bullish stock, MAs will act as Demand Zone (Dynamic Support).

- If stock is trading above MA, we can say the stock is Bullish

- If stock is trading below MA, we can say the stock is Bearish

MA should be used to find areas of Value. Price confirmation in conjunction with MA will be a deadly tool to trade

Every asset has its own pace of growth and decline. Some stock will take support from 21 EMA, some may take from 200 EMA. From my experience, I have found 89 and 200 EMA the most reliable for positional trades. Most of the assets respect these EMA levels.

Once the concept of MAs is understood well, it can be applied to all types of charts. The analysis remains the same. With help of MA, we are interested in analysing the trend and finding areas of value to participate in the trend.

For MA, you need only one data point for X number of periods. In OHLC charts, you have 4 data points – OPEN, HIGH, LOW, and CLOSE. So, to form a channel: plot 2 MA using 2 different data sets.

If the entire candle range channel of the stock is to be known, plot using High and Low data set. If body range is to be analysed try plotting using OPEN and CLOSE. We will use MA - HIGH LOW Channel as we are interested in learning the range of the asset.

CASE-1 Price is trading above MA Channel and

CASE-2 Price trading below MA Channel.

In the subsequent article, I will explain both cases in detail with charts.

This shows that people who have bought the asset are in profits as MA is below the CMP.

So, investors who are in profit will tend to square off the position. This will lead to supply in assets. Price may start correcting.

This shows that people who have Sold the asset are in profits as Avg sell price (MA value) is significantly above the CMP.

So FNO traders who are in profit will tend to square off the position.

This will lead to demand for assets. So, the price will start correcting.

The financial term for the assumption that an asset's price will tend to converge to the average price over time. A technique used in the computation of the average price using quantitative methods.

Combining Case 1 & 2 you will understand how mean reversion takes place.

The disparity index is a technical indicator that measures the relative position of an asset's most recent closing price to a selected MA and reports the value as a percentage

Higher Disparity: Chances to revert back to mean

Lower Disparity: Chances to go away from mean

I will explain Disparity Index in detail in my coming threads as part of this Twitter Thread Series

Using the Disparity Index and the Contra trend pattern, one can develop their own mean-reversion trading strategy. MAs are important trend indicators if used correctly with understanding one can frame its own simple trading strategy

MAs should be used as a Trend filter and should not be traded Standalone. Price confirmation is needed to initiate the trade.

Rising MA suggest - Bullish

Falling MA suggest - Bearish

India received foreign direct investment (FDI) worth $165 billion in the last two years. These were pandemic years when the world reeled from Covid-19. But even when India was devastated by the second wave, companies from a record 101 nations poured money into 57 sectors in 2021-22.

They were willing to set aside Covid uncertainties to put their money in the India story. In fact, the combined inflows to India during the pandemic years—$81.9 billion in 2020-21 and $83.5 billion in 2021-22— were more than what it mopped up in the first six years of the Manmohan Singh rule (2004-05 to 2009-10) or the first three years of the Narendra Modi regime (2014- 15 to 2016-17).

FDI inflows comprise equity investments, reinvested earnings and other capital. In the recent set of data for 2021-22, which the Reserve Bank of India released last month, Karnataka was the top recipient state with 38% share in FDI equity inflow, followed by Maharashtra (26%) and Delhi (14%). Karnataka received foreign money mainly in sectors such as computer software and hardware, automobile and education.

As the global economic crisis worsens with the Ukraine war, will India be able to keep this going? Will it be able to attract $100 billion FDI in a year? If so, when? GoI has not announced any target so far. Deepak Bagla, MD and CEO of Invest India, argues FDI is not just about money; it is about global acknowledgement and trust. “We can have FDI inflows worth $100 billion annually in 24 to 36 months, provided we have a supporting global ecosystem,” he says.

In addition to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, some other factors contributing to an increasingly unpredictable financial environment are high inflation and interest rates, concerns about an impending recession in some parts of the world, supply chain bottlenecks and shortage of inputs such as semiconductors. “Yet, India’s pace of growth will attract investors. It is the fastest growing large economy in the world,” says Bagla.

Invest India is an investment promotion and facilitation agency under the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade. Bibek Debroy, chairman of the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister, argues the number can surpass the $100 billon mark. “In three years from now, annual FDI inflow upwards of $120 billion is plausible,” he says. EVR Ramana Reddy, Karnataka’s additional chief secretary who helms key departments such as commerce, industries and IT, says India should attain the $100 billion FDI mark “very soon”, provided the startup ecosystem remains intact.

“Out of 100 unicorns created in India last year, 40 happened to be from Karnataka. Startups played a key role in our FDI inflows too,” he says. India’s FDI data since 2000-01 reflects a roller-coaster ride, at times witnessing a dramatic rise, for instance a 155% y-o-y jump in 2006-07, and then occasional slips such as a 26% shrinkage in 2012-13. Such swings in data make it difficult for analysts to project future FDI trends. In the last 22 years, gross FDI rose y-o-y in 17 years and fell on five occasions (2002-03, 2003-04, 2009-10, 2010-11, 2012-13).

In the past decade, FDI inflows contracted only once – in 2012-13. Top five contributors to India’s FDI equity inflow for the entire period (2000-22) are Mauritius (27% of the total), Singapore (22%), US (9%), the Netherlands (7%) and Japan (6%). In 2021-22, Singapore was the top investing country, followed by the US and Mauritius. However, India’s net foreign investments, a figure arrived at by subtracting the outflow (Indians buying assets abroad or foreigners selling assets in India), have not been robust particularly during the second year of the pandemic.

Net FDI fell to $39.3 billion in 2021-22 from $44 billion a year ago “due to higher outward FDI by India and repatriation by foreign investors”, according to an RBI bulletin issued last month. With more and more Indian companies buying assets in foreign soil, it is likely that there will be pressure on net FDI in the coming years as well. Net numbers, however, don’t take away from the fact that India has been receiving more foreign money during the pandemic. It’s mainly because most sectors are open for 100% FDI under the automatic route.

An emphasis on ease of doing business plus the recent rounds of reforms in FDI policy in sectors such as insurance, defence, petroleum and telecom have bulked up the kitty. Former Union industry secretary Ajay Dua says it is time for India to aggressively look out for foreign capital in the manufacturing sector by showcasing its production-linked incentive (PLI). “Most of India’s FDIs come via mergers and acquisitions.

We nee d to target more FDI i n fl ow s into greenfield manufactu- ring projects. We must constantly imp r o v e the PLI scheme and use it to attract FDI,” he says. The PLI scheme is believed to be the key reason why FDI in manufacturing went up by 76% in 2021-22.

STATE OF PLAY

While GoI’s policy initiatives were helpful, India’s FDI journey would not have been this remarkable (from $4 billion in 2000-2001 to $83.5 billion in 2021-22), had states not competed with each other to roll out the red carpet for foreign investors. FDI equity inflow from October 2019 to March 2022 shows Maharashtra (27% of total inflow), Karnataka (23%) and Gujarat (19%) were the top FDI recipients.

The other states attracting large FDIs include Delhi, Tamil Nadu, Haryana and Telangana. In 2021-22, 30 states and Union territories received FDIs, including northeastern states like Meghalaya ($1.09 mn) and Nagaland ($0.013 mn). Karnataka’s additional chief secretary Reddy says the state reached out to 1,500 global companies in the last one year, with 400 of them responding positively.

“This targeted approach will continue this year too. In Davos recently, our chief minister (Basavaraj Bommai) held meetings with 25 top CEOs. We instantly received an investment commitment of about `60,000 crore,” he adds. In neighbouring Telangana, about 500 CEOs of companies operating in the state are given the mobile numbers of IT and industries minister KT Rama Rao and principal secretary of industries and IT Jayesh Ranjan. “About 500 CEOs can contact us any day, anytime. If a message is dropped, we respond.

They can settle any issue instantly. The existing investors are our brand ambassadors,” says Ranjan, adding that in the eight years of the state’s existence, Telangana received $35 billion worth of FDI of which 24% was repeat investment. As states fiercely compete with each other to woo foreign investors, multinationals often deploy a smart tactic of negotiating with states simultaneously, creating almost a bidding war.

“True, if a foreign company wants to invest in India but finds another state offering better incentives, we bring in our policy of ‘meet and beat’. Means, we better that offer,” says Ranjan. A healthy race among states to woo foreign capital will help India accelerate the pace of reaching the $100 billion FDI milestone.

‘$120 billion FDI inflow plausible in three years’

By Bibek Debroy, Chairman, Economic Advisory Council to PM

FDI is desirable because it brings technology, efficiency and better management practices, enabling India to become part of the global supply chain. FDI is preferable to imports from other countries because multiplier bene ts occur in India and also because FDI aids exports. Depending on the product, there is both a domestic consumer market, which is increasing, and a cheaper production base for exporting, the last especially important because firms are seeking to diversify from former host destinations. From India’s perspective, financing current account deficits through nondebt-creating in ows like FDI are superior to inflows that create debt.

The government has progressively liberalised FDI entry. Defence, oil refineries, telecom, power exchanges, stock exchanges and insurance are cases in point. (For specific sectors, FEMA rules have been amended.) This is in addition to improving the business climate, which bene ts domestic and foreign investors alike. The numbers speak for themselves. From just over $45 billion in 2014-15, FDI inflows have increased to over $83 billion in 2021- 22. A large chunk of this is in the form of actual equity.

Global rankings show India remains an attractive investment destination and this has been reinforced in the course of the post-Covid recovery. At this rate, three years from now, annual in ow of upwards of $120 billion is plausible. Sectors not only indicate India’s comparative advantage (including that in R&D), but also the desirable outcome of reducing import dependence. Not just computer software, but computer hardware and drugs and pharmaceuticals come to mind. Add to that automobiles, telecom services, financial services, trading and a sector that India emphasises, renewable energy. Bilateral trade and investment agreements, now that WTO is in a bit of a limbo, facilitate FDI inflows and FDI doesn’t always mean inward FDI in ow into India. There is FDI out ow from India too. That’s precisely the reason India has been reviewing existing stock of such regional and bilateral agreements and is in the process of negotiating fresh ones.

For instance, other than Singapore, Mauritius and Cayman Islands, countries such as the US, Netherlands and the UK are major sources of FDI inflows. Quantum and nature of FDI is a function of the source country and the destination. While in an overall sense, the destination is India, FDI actually materialises in specific states and is thus dependent on the investment and business climate of that state.

Most FDI inflows have come into Karnataka, Maharashtra, Delhi, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and Haryana. There is, of course, a methodological problem in this, since investments, domestic and foreign, are shown against wherever corporate headquarters are located, not where manufacturing actually takes place. Nevertheless, this vindicates the perception about some states being more attractive destinations than others.

While liberalisation occurs at the level of Union government, many subsequent clearances (land, labour, water, electricity, environment) occur at state level, not to speak of transport and legal infrastructure. The reaction of states will determine whether, three years from now, annual inflows are $120 billion, or considerably higher.

The Recent Buzz in the Markets is regarding the Rossari Biotech IPO (Finished Day 1 with 60% subscription as on 13-July-2020).

For those who keep track of the markets must be aware that the company operates in Specialty Chemical sector which, at present, is being considered to be a very lucrative space to be in mainly on account of tailwinds expected by Indian companies due to China curbing on production because of the environmental issues and growing demand domestically.

Let’s analyze the IPO in terms of what is the ask and what can be expected as a return –

- The price band for the IPO is set to be 423- 425 INR at a P/E ratio of 33.1. As the prospectus talks about the industry till FY23, let’s take 3 years as our horizon for holding this stock till FY23. Now, the sector on an average is trading at the P/E of 27 and what this means is that Investors are willing to pay a premium, over industry average, which would have factored in the 18% growth CAGR in EPS over the next 3 years.

Note: 18% growth in EPS will give the FY23 Forward EPS of 20.9 which then if discounted by 10%(on a conservative side because the amount of risk is much higher as the company is relative new) will give an EPS of 15.7 INR which will give us the P/E of 27(same as Industry). The Current EPS is 12.8

-  So, under the assumption that the company will revert to the Industry average within 3 years, we will have to expect a growth of roughly 40% to command a 20% return annually on our investment which is rather on the optimistic side if not too ambitious.

- Now it can be argued that it will trade at a premium valuation throughout and then the EPS growth rate required to give a 20% return would be way less (approx. 20% ) which is quite reasonable considering this is the growth stock. In that case, I would quote from Intelligent Investor(by Ben Graham) that – “You don’t drive a truck with a load of 29,900 Pounds on a bridge with max capacity of 30,000 Pounds” – and doing so would just be tantamount to entering into a zone of speculation with no regards to the principle of Margin of Safety.

In Summary, the premium that the company is asking for is bit on the higher side which negates some of the existing advantages of low Debt/Equity ratio, presence in a growth industry, good historical growth rate(albeit on a lower base) and return on Capital, capacity expansion(in Dahej, Gujarat), strong cash position and market leader in textile specialty chemicals(one of the 3 segments in which company operates) in India. So, subscribe for listing gains or with a very minuscule part of portfolio. 

Any suggestions are most welcome and appreciated.

Majority of the sixteen stock exchanges have restricted trading,all major countries are in either in lock down state or have proposed restricting all physical entry. Is it 2008 in the making?

Lets hope its not the case this time.

Well, it makes perfect sense to avoid one to one interactions to avoid and cease the spread of ongoing COVID-19 in accordance with the WHO guidelines.

But what about the different Industries dependent on each other for basic raw material procurement,essentially FMCG which is a major part of our modern day to day consumption.

Deliveries have been delayed and some items such as sanitisers have gone off shelves or are unavailable online. Retailers and fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies said there are no shortages and that they will speed up supplies to shops besides seeking to curb hoarding.

Products such as rice, flour, pulses, edible oil, sugar, biscuit, tea, instant noodle, butter, frozen food, soaps, handwashes and floor cleaners are flying off the shelves in Mumbai, Delhi-NCR, Bengaluru, Pune, Hyderabad, Kochi, Thiruvananthapuram and Ahmedabad.

Panic buying is happening and likely to continue for at least one two weeks more,” said biscuit maker Parle Products category head Mayank Shah. “We have received frenzied calls from the trade to supply stock since the pipeline has become almost dry. (Source-ET)

The unprecedented demand has led to delays, with the shortage of delivery personnel adding to the bottleneck.

Whilst Amazon,Bigbasket,Grofers, Milkbasket have seen a surge in their demands up to 30%.

What about the materials that the manufacturing giants like HUL,Reckitt Benckiser,P&G ,Nestle procure?

The common man being optimistic on the control measures being deployed by the government shares a major opinion of ramping up production and maintaining exports.

It comes across as a breeze of fresh air in these tough times, but is the world in sync with our opinions?

Lets find out, where we take a deeper dive to how the Supply Chain Industry has functioned till now.Although we have seen major outbreaks earlier too but with digitisation and connectivity stepping in, the effect has turned from a ripple to wave within weeks.

The introduction of the Goods and Services Tax (GST), liberalising foreign direct investment (FDI) rules, and increased government spending has helped spur growth in the sector.

The Indian warehouse market was worth INR 561 Billion in 2018. The market is further projected to reach INR 968 Billion by 2024, growing at a CAGR of 9.5% during 2019-2024. Warehousing involves storage of goods and merchandise in order to protect the quality and quantity of the stored products awaiting future use. It is an integral part of the logistics value chain, forming the node, which allows for collection, sorting and dissemination of goods within the supply chain. (Source-IMarc)

The supply chain industry has a cascading impact on almost all aspects of trade and retail due to COVID-19.

In the last three years, India’s supply chain sector has seen an influx of capital, both foreign and domestic. Firms like Future Supply Solutions have raised almost US$2 billion (Rs 130 billion) in investments from domestic and foreign channels.

The French firm, FM Logistics, recently acquired Pune-based Spearhead Logistics, investing over US$8 million (Rs 500 million) with further plans to invest US$46 million (Rs 3 billion) to set up warehouses all over India.

The Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor and Development Corporation (DMICDC) has awarded companies over US$2.3 billion (Rs 150 billion) in contracts for the development of multimodal logistics hubs in Maharashtra, Gujarat, and the National Capital Region (NCR). They are in the process of granting another US$1.5 billion (Rs 102 billion) in contract packages for construction of the same in the states of Uttar Pradesh and Haryana.

The decision was made in an inter-ministerial meeting held on (20-03-2020) to maintain the supply of goods and services during any lockdown period, which also discussed on issues relating to operations of retail (ecommerce), wholesale, distribution, transport, and warehousing. The department has advised state governments and local administration to exempt ecommerce operations including logistics and warehousing), wholesaler, their vendors and third-party delivery partners who are part of the supply and logistics chain ecosystem, from any type of prohibitory orders.

However, the department has noted that ecommerce companies and delivery partners are required to maintain proper hygiene and sanitation in their facilities, and vehicles, they may be regularly inspected and disinfected.

This can be seen as a huge win for the ecommerce sector, which has been devising strategies to fulfil the spike in demand over the last few weeks.

 While retail giant Flipkart announced that it would suspend its services due to the lockdown but will be back as soon as possible. Amazon India also said it has temporarily stopped taking orders and disabled shipment of low-priority products to focus on delivery of essential items.

Drop shipping is a supply chain management method in which the retailer does not keep goods in stock but instead transfers its customer's orders and shipment details to either the manufacturer, another retailer, or a wholesaler, who then ships the goods directly to the customer. As in retail business, the majority of retailers make their profit on the difference between the wholesale and retail price, but some retailers earn an agreed percentage of the sales in commission, paid by the wholesaler to the retailer.

Wholesale in India can cost businesses more money through the cost of goods, the cost of shipping and expensive employee costs. The cost of goods are high because large quantities need to be purchased to ensure good pricing without a guarantee that they’ll be sold. Shipping costs are high because individual entrepreneurs don’t have access to government deals such as ePacket. Employee costs are high because you need to hire a bigger team to package and ship products as your business grows. Dropshipping allows businesses to automate most of their business so that they focus on tasks that generate revenue like marketing or building strong relationships through customer service.

With present situation we hardly had the time to devise a go to strategy, however it makes perfect sense to engage all stakeholders in the supply network to work on a supply and customer centric model to control and minimise the extrapolating effect of this pandemic.

This article is a individual opinion and welcomes all inputs in form of comments for further refinement and outreach.

From March 23 till date, what a rally Nifty and global markets have seen. S&P 500 and NASDAQ hitting record highs every day, Dow at pre-covid levels, Nifty 50 at around 300 points away from 12,000 levels, and FIIs net buyers from quite some time. What lies ahead is being stock specific, and not putting your fingers in everything you see with momentum.

Here are few companies, I believe is decently valued and have a lot of steam left to rally.

1. Mirza International- Valued at around 1.00 PB, 14.36 PE, dividend yield of 1.6%, it is cheap. Companies with solid brand value usually are valued at 2.00 PB plus. This company owns the RedTape brand and also contract manufactures premium boots for brands around the world. What makes this attractive is its dominance in the e-commerce space. Shift to shirtings and textile, will expand earnings aggressively, I personally forecasts that at 30% CAGR from now for next coming years. Promoters increasing holdings, recent dividend announcement of Rs3 per share, all positives.

2. Greaves Cotton- According to its technicals, it has made a good bottom around Rs 80.50 per share. I would suggest this for seriously patient individuals and its dominance for e-two wheeler segment, and thriving rural economy is reason for the same. With management with good history and education gives comfort over its accountability to investors and its constant innovation with its agriculture products shows its competence to grow. Decently valued has major upside.

3. Prakash Industries- It’s rolled from my previous pick in my last article and have already returned 150% from the level I suggested. Steel prices are in major uptrend and recent events have led Indian Steel to export in large numbers, opening a new market all together. BAT by govt. further will help indian metals, and this gem is valued decently, promoters releasing pledged shares, using sponge iron with its own integrated iron ore mine, helps to swim over the hurdle caused by iron ore prices hitting $100 levels. I see this stock to be valued at 0.6 PB by EOY 2020, which again is about 100% from here on.

4. Parag Milk Products- This stock is again very cheap, and will be huge beneficiary of drastic shift in consumer behavior caused by coronavirus. According to recent interview with Amul Head, during lockdown cheese consumption have increased by 40% in India. As people are trying to make food more at home, consumption of cheese and baking soda are increasing rapidly. This company owns Go Cheese brand which holds around 35% market share, second to Amul with 42% market share. Consumption of such products have not taken a hit and recently promoters have paid almost all its debt, leading to an upgrade of its LOC by major rating agencies. Valued at around 1.00 PB, have upside of 2x from this levels.

5. Allied ESports-(Trading in NASDAQ) This is an American company and so majority of my readers won’t be accessible to this stock. Decently valued, I got this stock in my search of next Amazon, Netflix. The return this can generate over a period of 10 years is immense. With companies like Microsoft and Reliance, understanding the dominance of e-sports, this company will benefit from early entry, its ties ups with betting companies and so on. Being an American company with core business in e-sports, with liquidity available in excess, it can return like other tech biggies.

For a quarter of a century, India’s voters elected governments which were born with an alibi — the lack of a majority which ‘allegedly’ hampered change and transformation. In May 2014, the voters delivered a mandate, a brute majority that left the opposition decimated and the new government with no alibis.

The mandate was fuelled by hapless frustration with the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance regime and, more pertinently, the idea of solution-oriented politics — promised in words and in the presentation of the Gujarat Model as an alternative. The campaign, the slogans, the rhetoric were populated with words and sentiments that the people of India wanted to hear. The 50-plus page Bharatiya Janata Party Election manifesto was as crisp as a promissory note, listing imperatives and approach to solutions.

A year before the next round of hustings it would be fair to ask if the BJP government has done what it said it would do. The short answer would be, the intent has been executed. The many issues India faced have been articulated with smart slogans and programmes. The gap between intent and execution, between success and the slippery slope of sloth, has been about lack of ministerial capacity.

On the social front, the successful implementation of the Jan Dhan Yojana with over 315 million accounts opened, the rural electrification of 18,000 villages, the building of toilets under the Swachh Bharat Mission, the Ujwala Yojana for LPG connectivity to poor homes in rural India, the acceleration of rural road connectivity and the newly launched Saubhagya Yojana for rural household electrification are manifestations where the regime came together.

On the economic front, opening up of FDI in defence and insurance, the passage of the Goods and Services Tax, and the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code would merit applause. Of course, there are inadequacies — the dormant Jan Dhan accounts, the lack of water for toilets, the replacement gap in Ujwala — and the fact is both GST and the IBC are yet work in progress.

The larger question that begs to be asked is whether the BJP-led NDA, which for all intents and purposes has been a BJP government, has leveraged its mandate and the historic majority to deliver what it lured voters with, in its manifesto.

The BJP government came to power at the intersection of a political and economic crisis. Its mandate was an illustration of the need for rebooting the way government functioned and the manner in which development policies were authored. It had the opportunity on five fronts to induct long-term transformation but has been rather tentative.

Earlier this week, State Bank of India reported its largest ever loss in a quarter. It was the fifth successive public sector bank to report a loss, a rise in provisions and a higher level of bad loans. PSBs account for the bulk of bad loans worth over Rs 9 lakh crore in the system. At least five defaulters of the Nirav Modi kind have absconded in the past four years. In every debate, the BJP strains its sloganeering sinew to assert that the state of the public sector banks has been the result of corrupt practices of the previous regime. Manifest in the argument is the reality of systemic issues. Every third public sector undertaking or 75 of the 244 PSUs are in the red, losing over Rs 25,000 crore. In the past five years, PSU losses add up to over Rs 1.06 lakh crore. The issue is about government ownership, but more about political management of government enterprises.

Why not disinvest in favour of the public — the stupendous rise of stock markets offered an opportunity to do so — and create a Temasek or a Sovereign Fund for the government’s holdings so that the PSUs are corporatised and professionally managed? Must the PSUs await the fate of Air India?

Farmers in Ahmednagar, Sangli, Satara, and Kolhapur are giving away milk for free, in protest. Some weeks ago, farmers were dumping tomatoes on the highway. Elsewhere those who grew tur dal at the exhortation of the government find no takers or poor remuneration for their crop. Parties, regional and national, are promising farmers loan waivers at every assembly election — at last count, over Rs 1 lakh crore has been paid up.

Every land owning community across the country — Jats, Marathas, Patels and others — is up in arms for reservations in government jobs.

The approach to resolving the agrarian crisis must go beyond the charity of politics, a nod for a waiver or a nudge of the support prices. At an average holding of under 2 hectares, farming is simply unviable. The option is collective farming or contract farming. As early as in the 1950s, Vithalrao Vikhe Patil, the father of the sugar cooperative movement, installed the power of the collective. Four years into its term, the government released a model law this week on contract farming for states to adopt, and the punctuating ifs and buts of implementation will follow. It is a start but a law is only a string of words unless championed politically, followed with investment in the ecosystem and dismantling of the political stranglehold over markets and pricing of exports and imports. Agriculture is a business and requires to be enabled by both forward and backward linkages — inputs, credit, investment in technology and access to free markets. It demands liberating India’s largest private sector.

One of the issues haunting India’s economy is centralisation of ideas and lack of decentralisation of initiative, funds, functions and functionaries. Given the diversity and diverse aspiration, the BJP in its 2014 manifesto identified the need for Centre and States to work together. It said “Team India shall not be limited to the Prime Minister-led team sitting in Delhi, but will also include chief ministers and other functionaries as equal partners.”

Yet the discourse on the economy yet revolves around what the Centre has done or not done. The promise of ‘regional councils’ has not quite taken off. Inadequate investment is haunting the economy yet permission raj reigns — investors are plagued by a plethora of clearances at central and state levels.

The BJP has since 2014 has won elections and is now in power in 20 states, with allies and on its own. It is in power in the most populated states, the largest states, the most industrialised and those rich with mineral resources. To borrow from cricket, the players have not come to the party yet. The manifesto also declared that “the moribund forums like ‘National Development Council’ and ‘Inter-State Council’ will be revived and made into active bodies.” For sure, the NITI Aayog is supposed to play a role in enabling collaboration and cooperation, but the harsh reality is that the propulsion must come from political initiatives from chief ministers.

For instance economic cluster zones are known to drive investment, employment and growth. Why can’t Bihar and Uttar Pradesh tie up for a special agricultural zone? Why can’t Maharashtra and Gujarat create a Shenzhen like zone leveraging the human and material resources of Mumbai-Surat-Nashik? Must the states await the Centre to draft a model labour law or contract farming law?

There are good reasons why three decades after the British show Yes Ministerwas wound up, the line “Paperwork is the religion of civil service” is widely and wildly popular in India. Principally the humour, the inherited legacy, and then there is continuity.

In its 2014 manifesto, the BJP declared: “Administrative reforms will be a priority for the BJP. Hence, we propose to implement them through an appropriate body under the PMO” and that it will “generate ‘Kartavya Bhavna’ among public servants as lives and productivity of people is dependent on the quality and efficiency of public services.” Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari once narrated an incident where he found payment clearances to road developers passing through many tables and asked, “must everyone have Lakshmi Darshan”? On the ground services in some areas have improved but the general complaint of denizens is about drift and graft. There has been some movement — the digitisation of processes, an online system to assess probity and performance and action against officers — but the overhaul is yet to be, and not just for the central government.

The idea of minimum government, maximum governance demands reforms for institutional and individual efficacy. Incidentally, the British government has pushed through four phases of civil service reforms beginning with the ‘Next Steps’ in 1987.

If there was one item on the 2014 manifesto that had omnipotence — social, political and economic — it was the promise to “initiate building 100 new cities; enabled with the latest in technology and infrastructure adhering to concepts like sustainability, walk to work etc, and focused on specialised domains.” Urbanisation is well established as a growth multiplier. The many failings of governance owe their genesis to access — education, healthcare and the shifting of farm workers to factories and services. By 2015 the idea of ‘100 new cities’ became 100 smart cities.

In December 2017 of the Rs 9,860 crore allocated, barely Rs 645 crore was utilised and the rest awaited plans, sanctions, and implementation.

Urbanisation currently is amoebic growth ratified post facto with poor infrastructure and connectivity. The worsening state of affairs is reflected in data on waste management, water supply and air pollution. There is no disputing that existing cities require capacity enhancement but more importantly, India needs new cities — at least twin cities or satellite towns — to take the pressure off large cities. The point is not to build another Mumbai or Delhi but new cities well designed and smarter habitats offering citizens a choice. It need not have been 100 cities. Even 10 cities would have created a demonstration effect, for instance, one near the new Navi Mumbai airport alongside the Special Economic Zones. The May 2016 Urban Development Ministry advice to states to convert 3,894 census towns into urban local bodies remains that. New cities could have been carved out of the suffering 3,800 census towns. Nearly half of India’s billion-plus populace will be living in urban areas — in new cities or census towns or undefined agglomerations. They deserve better.

John F Kennedy once said, that the two brush strokes “in Chinese for crisis or ‘Wei Ji’ stand for danger and opportunity. In a crisis, be aware of the danger — but recognize the opportunity.” Issues faced by India require leveraging crises into opportunities for true transformation.
