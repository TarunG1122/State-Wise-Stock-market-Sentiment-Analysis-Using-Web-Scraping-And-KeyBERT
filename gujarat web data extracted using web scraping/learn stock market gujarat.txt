‚ÄùI was studying to be an architect, I wasn't plotting to join the movies. Films were just another career option. I took acting up with the same schoolgirl enthusiasm I had for Architecture. The flexibility in the curriculum and the creative of the course really helped me to pursue my dreams.‚Äù says Aishwarya Rai Bachchan
It is not always the experience that teaches you to be a better person, but your willingness which makes you work and learn hard for it. in fact, it is ultimately on us, to grab the best opportunities that come in our way. and make the best out of it. Architecture has always remained first career choice of gorgeous and glamorous girls like Aishwarya.
Faculty of Architecture & Planning - Parul University
is proud to share this fact and aspires potential students to ‚Äù#Join_Architecture_and_be_like_her...‚Äù-
The fashion shows during the University annual festival would become the first step for all such students to become fashion icon like her.

Gujaratis are considered to be an ‡§â‡§§‡•ç‡§∏‡§µ-‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§ø‡§Ø (festival loving) community. Our calendar years begin with the celebration of #Uttarayan (#MakarSankranti), the festival of #kites. Members of my community are also considered to be the movers and shapers of stock markets in the country. I try and narrate a few lessons that I learnt regarding the stock markets from the festival of Uttarayan-

Sustained presence of wind is an extremely important component for the festival of Uttarayan to be enjoyed wholeheartedly. On a few festival days, the wind is in abundance while on other occasions, it is scarce beyond frustration. On an average out of the four sessions (morning-evening) on the 14-15th of every January, there is at least a presence of any two forms of wind phases- High, Medium & Low Wind. These differing phases typify the Bullish and Bearish trends in stock markets. Depending on these three phases, the following observations come to my mind-

'‡§¨‡§π‡•Å‡§§ ‡§π‡§µ‡§æ ‡§π‡•à ‡§Ø‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§Ü‡§ú ‡§§‡•ã' phase

- Notwithstanding the fundamentals of a particular company's scrip, there is a certain sense of 'feel-good' in the market during a bullish phase. It tends to bringing the irregular investors (trying to make a quick buck) into the stock-markets too. One can go and check stock market numbers before the Reliance Power IPO in early 2008 to get a feel of the same. Nearly every kind of scrip has the ability to make money, operator-run scrips make hay while the sun shines and intra-day trading tend to reach an all-time high.

- This is the phase which exhibits abundance of wind thereby making kite-flying easier. One needs to only give a push (thumka) to the kite when it is placed in an apt direction and the wind does the rest of the work. This phase witnesses almost all the participants on the terrace coming into the picture. The selfie-generation youngsters, who were till now glued to their snapchat and Instagram accounts, sometimes suo-moto while sometimes on being coaxed by their parents, show some intent to pursue kite-flying too. All kind of kites, without proper knot tied (kinya) or one without proper knot-balancing (sun-sun) and in some cases, when some auteurs decide to fly even the partially torn kites, they all fly far and high.

'‡§π‡§µ‡§æ ‡§ï‡§π‡§æ‡§Å ‡§π‡•à ‡§Ø‡§æ‡§∞' phase

- This is the phase when the bears take over. The investors tend to lose money and in the process, the non-serious investors are the first ones to take a flight out of the markets. Foreign Investors, only there in the country, to make a quick-buck follow the suit. Full-time investors use this time to take a stock of their investments and learn lessons for the future. One tends to only restrict their monies to the blue-chip or the set of companies with the strongest fundamentals in the market. They also tend to find other avenues such as gold, real-estate, commodities to park their money till they find the markets more conducive to further invest.

- Similarly, the wind sometimes just suddenly disappears during Uttarayan. In a few cases, the Meteorological Department already announces like Dr. Rajan that a crisis in the form of lack of wind is impending. The 'mentally-not-fully'-kite flyers' community are the first ones to make this an excuse and get back to their phones and tablets. Only the lightest, the most nimble and balanced kites, if one decides to fly, must be used in such cases. The real connoisseurs also tend to invest this opportunity to experiment, teach kids and the ones intending to learn the art of kite-flying by using the time to show them the related practical aspects of kite-flying sans the actual process. They also tend to find alternate means to invest their time by joining their family members in playing cards and in case, if there are enough takers, cricket on the terrace.

'‡§á‡§§‡§®‡•Ä ‡§§‡•ã ‡§π‡§µ‡§æ ‡§π‡•à, ‡§î‡§∞ ‡§ï‡§ø‡§§‡§®‡•Ä ‡§ö‡§æ‡§π‡§ø‡§è?' phase

- This is the phase which exhibits the scenario of near perfect competition in the #StockMarkets. With balanced set of winds (good-news- positive economy numbers, economic performance, global headwinds etc.) flowing intermittently, one can afford to lose any chance especially towards the end of the day. There is a need for a certain amount of effort in the beginning but once the scrip crosses a certain threshold (meets a desired/expected objective), things take off. There are enough chances to gain arbitrage by making informed risk-taking decisions where the investor is confident about his/her investment decision.

- In a colony with equal sized flats counting in over a couple of dozens, nearly every terrace gives you an opportunity to fly and cut as many kites in the phase of balanced wind. One must not lose any opportunity to fly kites as during the end of the day as at this time, everyone is jostling for that one inch of space on the terrace to fly the kite. Hence, the rush during this period, makes the Darwin's theory come into the picture; the one who is the most adaptable to change- keeps his kites fly-ready, picks the most suitable side of the terrace to fly kites, ends up enjoying the most. There will be extra rush and hence, in the initial phase, one must not get frustrated and keep patience. Once you are out of the initial clutter, the results will follow. :)

And last but not the least,

Sentiment is an extremely important factor that determines how stock markets perform especially in a shorter run. For example, look at the stock market numbers during those 15-odd minutes when Congress took lead during the counting of Gujarat Election Results 2017. It all depends on which party is perceived by the markets to be more conducive for the nation at any given point of time and this perception is what drives the sentiment.

Similarly the sentiment during a particular Uttarayan is very important. During this year's Uttarayan (14th), there was a perception of lack of wind. More so, there were messages from several other areas that there is an absence of a proper amount of wind. Being on terrace for nearly a third of the first session (1 hour) and the entire second session, I can vouch that there was enough air to be considered for the third phase however the narrative being the opposite, many did not really venture out until it was the final hour of the evening.

As a community, we thrive on taking risks and in attempting great things. Nearly everything that can teach us, we try and derive lessons from the same. Then may it be traveling in the Third Class in Indian Railways or flying kites in the first class atmosphere of Gujarat during Uttarayan, we are a lot more than just a traders' community. 

Aavjo. :)

I love playing professional matchmaker. It's my favorite part of business.

I'm sure if I were born 100 years ago in my family's native home of Gujarat, India, I would be the annoying uncle always trying to set people up in relationships.

But my modern, software company version of that urge manifests in helping link career seekers to their next opportunities. And I've hit a goldmine of opportunities in the customer success profession.

As I've tweeted many times, the customer success leadership job market is white hot.

Every week, several CEOs reach out to us at Gainsight asking for advice, intros, and background checks on hiring a leader. We've spent the last six or seven years growing the world's largest network of customer success leaders, and I absolutely love using it to help professionals and companies connect.

Although I'm not a recruiter by profession, I've been able to learn a lot about customer success more broadly by facilitating some of these connections. And several of my colleagues have done the same. We've also enjoyed comparing notes with the pros in this topic‚Äîexecs like Alexis Hennessy and Kelly Kay at Heidrick & Struggles, Rich Decembrele at Kindred Partners and Mike Doonan at SPMB.

We've learned five key things about hiring customer success leaders:

"Customer success" is such a buzzword that, shockingly, many LinkedIn titles have changed to it very recently. That means you need to cut through the noise and get specific about what you're looking for. Some key questions to consider:

We put together a list of top questions I get from CEOs here. Spoiler alert: they're mostly about finding and empowering great leaders!

CS is a conundrum. On one hand, the teams get big quickly, so leadership scale matters. On the other hand, the field is so new and evolving that leaders need to be able to innovate quickly.

We've found that the candidates that resonate the most with hirers have a mix of large company (e.g., Salesforce.com) and young startup experience.

I wrote in detail on who the next generation of CS leadership will be in this blog.

Harshad Mehta was born on 29 July, 1954 at Rajkot, Gujarat. A cricket enthusiast, Mehta did not show any special promise in school and came to Bombay after his schooling for studies and to find work. Mehta completed his B.Com in 1976 from Lajpatrai college Bombay and worked a number of odd jobs for the next eight year.

He worked at companies like New India Assurance, P Ambalal, PD Shukla, JL Shah, and Nandala Seth.

In 1984, he along with his brother started his own company named ‚ÄúGrow More Research and Asset Management‚Äù.

He did lobbying of shares.

To understand it better let‚Äôs say he started creating artificial demand of share in the market. Manipulating the stock to increase the prices tremendously.

This is done by using tipping strategy in the market.

Let‚Äôs understand better with an example.

Harshad Mehta circulated a message with help of different agencies that stock XYZ is a buy at the price of Rs. 1000 and the target price is Rs. 2200.

We would normally ignore such messages knowing that it is fake. But the Mehta used to invest huge funds into this XYZ Company and try creating a artificial demand of this particular stock.

As per normal economics when demand increases and supply remains constant, automatically the prices start increasing. The prices start increasing from Rs. 1000 to Rs. 1500, 1700.

Now it is obvious we will try to get into this stock seeing the increase in the price.

People would invest at a level where Mehta is about to withdraw the funds by selling the shares.

Let‚Äôs say he withdrew at a rate of Rs. 2000, people would invest now thinking it will reach 2200. As Mehta sells a large number of shares directly impacting the prices and the price falls tremendously.

This way he earned a huge amount of money.

From the example itself it is clear he made investment at Rs.1000 and sold that at Rs. 2000, simply making it 2 times of the investment.

He invested in different companies and to name some ‚Äì Apollo tyres, Reliance, Tata Iron and Steel, BPL, Videocon, ACC.

When he invested in ACC the share price went from Rs. 200 to Rs. 9000

If we simply calculate it is 4500% return. Just imagine the amount of money he made doing this.

He created a trustworthy image in the market and was also known as Amitabh Bachchan of stock market.

He was one of the biggest Indian Tax Payer.

The instruments that he used to execute all this were:

1)  Ready Forward Deal (RFD)

2)  Bank Receipts (BR)

Let‚Äôs first understand these terms:

RFD ‚Äì It is a secured short term loan which is given from one bank to another.

BR ‚Äì It refers to a receipt issued by the lending bank to the borrowing bank on receiving the securities and lending money in exchange of that.

Harshad Mehta was the broker in between the different banks.

Bank B required funds so it decided to sell government securities to the broker.

Now the broker went to Bank A and received funds in his name and promising to get the securities.

He kept both the securities and the money with him too and presented a fake Bank Receipt to Bank B promising to pay.

Same way he approached Bank C and Bank D.

Issued fake bank receipts when needed. 

This way he kept on expanding the ready forward deal chain series.

The Bank Receipts confirms the sale of securities and states that the securities are held by the seller in trust of the buyer. It also acts as a receipt for the received funds by the selling bank.

The Bank of Karad (BOK) and Mumbai Mercantile Co-operative bank (MCB) had helped him issuing fake receipts for the same.

This kept on expanding and fake receipts were issued on a very large scale.

As he was one of the highest tax payer so he had manipulating power over BSE as well.

As per the RBI norms the lending bank should always issue the funds in the name of borrower bank but it didn‚Äôt happen. The funds were issued in the name of Harshad Mehta.

This kept on going until 23rd April, 1993 when a journalist Sucheta Dalal went into deep research about the same and exposed the Mehta scam. She did a background study about the tremendous increase in share price in the market and wrote a column in TOI.

Her article proved ‚ÄúPen is mightier than sword‚Äù.

The financial scandal valued around Rs. 5000 crore in total.

Key weaknesses of the case:

1)  The loopholes in the banking system.

2)  BSE transaction system.

3)  SEBI introduced new rules to cover the loopholes in the existing ones.

On 31st Dec 2001, Harshad Mehta died while being into the custody.

I spent twenty years of my life learning banking from Mr. Aditya Puri. I bear testimony to the fact that this man could make a donkey win a derby. I would like to share just 12 lessons from the vast amount I learnt from him. The man doesn‚Äôt suffer fools easily and if you have survived that long with him, you have learnt lessons in leadership, no business school could teach. Fun Fact: What you could not learn by paying top dollars, I learnt while getting paid for it!

1.      Clarity. You never went to his cabin in which he sat on a desk that had no computer and no papers, and came back without a clear direction. In mediocre minds lies a grey box in which thoughts, opinions, hopes and fear create a spaghetti bowl of confusion. This man had only two boxes. The action box and the dust bin. Through a complex presentation, he caught the essence you managed to lose in fancy slides. The man cuts through clutter and makes it look so obvious that you come out feeling foolish.

2.      Results. Through all details even as you began the man saw the end. ‚ÄúWhere is my laddu?‚Äù You talked about a new product, a new process, new technology even as you laboured on the details, he has reached the end and is making you re-think even as you are presenting. Focus on the end, often he would pause me mid stream and say, "arre gujjubhai pachi su?" (in the end what will I get?)

3.      Controlled Aggression. Behind the Punjabi sales veneer lies a Gujarati mind on risk and a Marwadi mind on returns. The man can beat a dozen Jews at a breakfast table.

4. Impatient Patience. The man had an impatient streak in him. He demanded the best and as of yesterday and yet he had the patience to play the impatience game for twenty five years!

5.      Focus. Sir Don Bradman‚Äôs backlift started before the ball was delivered. The bottom of his bat was approximately level with the tops of the stumps at the instant of delivery. For twenty five years, Mr. Puri read each delivery even before the ball left the bowlers hand and had the perfect shot for it. Physically he left work at 5 pm every day, mentally he never left office for twenty five years.

6. Details. The man knew that the god of retail lives in the details. No matter how large the bank became, there was nothing happening within or not happening within that he wasn‚Äôt aware of. He delegated freely but had a hawk eye on everything that mattered. The man had bifocal vision. He had a telescope in one eye and a microscope in another.

7. On-ground. We feared his branch reviews. The man connected with branch managers and their teams and god help you if he found out a loss in transmission between what you thought you were implementing and on ground reality. And trust me, if there was a miss, he never missed. As the bank became larger he went deeper.

8.      Win. The man knew that every battle is first won in the mind. He would not lose any game he played and if his team couldn‚Äôt, he stepped in to lift the heavy load. This man could win the game with any team you gave him. Under this captain, each player raised his game beyond their own limitations.

9.      Groom. I was 26 years old. He told me to launch Retail Assets for the bank. So many others in the bank like me would testify, he gave you responsibilities far beyond your capabilities and then with his take no prisoners approach, this master raised your capabilities in his school of hard knocks. At 1064 degrees Celsius gold melts into liquid from where it can be forged into any shape of your choice. In this man‚Äôs oven you either emerged as a fine ornament or if you did not have the mettle you melted in the process. If you can't stand that heat get out of his oven.

10. Coconut. Don't judge it by the shell. The man genuinely cared for you. He is a tender coconut once you know him well. Feedback was instantaneous. It could appear to be harsh but it was never personal. If you did a stupid thing, he told you that it was a stupid thing!

11. Nobody needed to manage this boss. If you managed to deliver what was expected, the boss managed himself. If not, then he managed you till you delivered to expectations.

12.Karma Yogi. Krishna describes the attitude of a Karma Yogi in the second chapter of the Bhagwad Geeta and this man epitomises it. For him, his work was his reward. The effort was the joy. The results were simply something that followed. Amongst leaders of straw in Financial Services, the man taught you professional and personal integrity and the art of straight talk.

Learning banking from Mr Puri, was like learning archery from Dronacharya. I may not be Arjun, but this man could twirl a donkey's tail and light fire under it and soon often to its own surprise, it ran ahead of the thoroughbred stallions. Three years into entrepreneurship with SBFC Finance, I keep turning to him for advice, inspiration and mentoring and even today, my greatest reward continues to be that elusive "well done" from him.

Mr Puri, I shall always remain in gratitude with a debt I can only hope to pay it forward.

Post-use corrugated packaging material is commonly known as ‚Äúcardboard", while it is typically referred to as OCC or Old Corrugated Cardboard/ Containers to industry insiders. Very often, recycling and waste haulers use the term OCC in reference to cardboard. Corrugated cardboard can easily be recognized by its multiple layer structure; the fluted or wavy middle layer between sheets of paper keeps corrugated board light and gives it the strength to carry products.

Cardboard is a very useful packaging material for easy transportation of many different types of products. If OCC is kept dry and clean, recycling is straightforward as long as all non-paper materials such as bubble wrap, wood skids, plastic bags, plastic wrapping and Styrofoam are removed.

Corrugated Cardboard Production and Recycling Statistics

On average, a corrugated box contains roughly 50 percent recycled fiber. Around 51 percent of OCC is used to make new corrugated board, will 11.5 percent is used for boxboard materials, such as cereal boxes. Around 32 percent of recycled OCC is exported.

The size and type of business can have a strong bearing on OCC generation. Studies suggest that this material can represent as much as 40 percent or more of solid waste in a retail establishment and 15 percent or more of solid waste generated in an office setting. A small convenience store is estimated to produce between 700-1000 lbs of OCC per month, while grocery supermarkets generate between 8-30 tons, and department stores 8-20 tons during that time span.

Benefits of OCC Recycling

There are a number of benefits to recycling OCC instead of discarding it. Recycling OCC reduces energy and water usage, while cutting the production of greenhouse gas and certain air pollutants like total reduced sulfur (TRS), volatile organic chemicals (VOCs), and hazardous air pollutants (HAP). The recycling cardboard also reduces demand for virgin timber. It takes approximately three tons of trees to manufacture just one ton of virgin cardboard. Recycling helps reduce waste tipping fees as well. The recycling of one ton of cardboard saves more than nine cubic yards of landfill space.

Methods of Handling OCC

Before being placed in the storage containers, however, corrugated boxes should be opened and flattened. As well, harmful contaminants must be removed. This ensures better space utilization as well as that the material is clean and ready for recycling. Ensure that the container is accessible to haulers for pickup.

To bale or not to bale is an important decision in OCC recycling.

For small businesses which generate a comparatively small amount of OCC, bundling OCC manually, storing the loose OCC in a suitable container and having it collected by a hauler is ideal. On the other hand, businesses which generate a large amount of OCC should use large storage containers and compact or bale it using an industrial baler for the efficient transportation of OCC to recycling centers. One emerging technology is the use of shredding in combination with compaction or baling to increase the density of material for transport.

Old Corrugated Cardboard Recycling Process

Recycling corrugated containers is straightforward. It involves diverting old cardboard from waste stream, the elimination of contaminants, and the flattening or compressing of material to promote ease of handling, storing, delivering the stock to a paper production mill or processor where it is processed into different paper products such as recycled paperboard, the center fluting of corrugated boxes, and as unbleached craft paperboard.

Selling OCC

Depending upon the amount of OCC generated, the selling relationship will vary. Large generators may deal directly with paper companies, while mid-level generators may deal with recycling companies, and very small generators may sell to smaller operators acting to aggregate material for sale. No matter how much OCC is generated, it is important to recycle.

The earliest human civilizations developed around waterbodies be it Egyptian or Indus valley civilizations. These settlements would have been difficult without water, which was essential for both agriculture and drinking. Rivers also served as a means of transportation between settlements, facilitating trade and the development of banking and other services.

Once humans mastered the art of transporting water the second phase of development happened around cities that are well connected through various modes of transportation. the next phase of development will happen around cities that are planned in terms of infrastructure and have a laid-out plan for business policies and incentives which will help businesses prosper and generate employment and is well connected to business centers.
