Abhin Kakkad has scored 99.81 percentile in his CAT examination and secured his admission at the prestigious Post Graduate Program in Management (PGPM) at IIM Ahmedabad.
He is currently pursuing his B.Tech at DAIICT (with honors in Computational Sciences). Abhin is also an avid writer and have his own education based blog called ‚ÄòOriginating Ideas‚Äô with an objective of sharing information, strategies, and techniques for studying for entrance examinations. Abhin is part of the Computational Science program at DAIICT. He said, ‚ÄúThe analytical reasoning that I developed because of these courses and with the help of our faculties has helped me a lot on this journey‚Äù
Abhin had done his summer internship with Prof. Alka Parikh of DA-IICT in the field of Development Trajectories. This included understanding and documenting the development trajectories of Oman and the Baltic States. Analysis of the countries‚Äô economic growth using regression and t-test. He wrote two chapters on the above countries, which got accepted for the book which the professor is writing on this subject. He previously interned with an NGO called South Gujarat Backward Class Seva Mandal (DGPVSM) for his rural internship. One of Abhin‚Äôs important projects which was the highlight during his IIM-A interview was the analysis of stock market fluctuations in which the goal was to establish universality behaviour for different parameters of the stock indices by studying data from stock markets of the top 6 GDP nations.
Nostalgia hit Abhin hard and he says, ‚ÄúGetting into IIM Ahmedabad has been my goal since I was in 10th standard and I had always dreamt about studying in that red brick walled campus and today when this dream is a reality, I don‚Äôt have many words to express that feeling. Being a GEM (General Engineer Male) as well as a fresher it is extremely difficult to get into IIM Ahmedabad‚Äù. Abhin prepared for his CAT exam since last 2 years and on an average, he had given in 6 hours of daily preparation.
When asked, any advice for his juniors, he said, ‚ÄúHave faith in God and believe in yourself! Keep working.‚Äù
